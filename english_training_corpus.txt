Acephalous

Friday May 



Because i’ve been grading all damn day and am as tired as a Swearengen of hearing
other about the finished semesters of pretty much every other academic blogger 
I thought that it might be best to avoid jealously lashing out and scribble a
 Best of Acephalous   post However when I started
looking through my archives it occurred to me that my output this year defines
me much more sharply than in years past What do I mean  
The posts I consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to
have been composed in Granted the likelihood that i’m suffering from the
identitarian equivalent of presentism is awfully high but I honestly thought
Id written some of the posts from early in or so It may also be
that I remember the scene of their writing which would have been in the old
apartment i e the place I barely remember ever having
lived in anymore If you have absolutely nothing better to do on a Friday
night feel free to scan through my 
archives and tell me what you think should be included in the  Best of 
post 
If you do have something better to do though by all means do
it

Why is someone so young not having fun with friends on a Friday night 
Granted grading papers is important but no fun makes for a boring life I
should know  since when I was your age I had fun playing with my adorable
son and caring for another baby You need to try to have a life outside your
computer Just saying it seems I have more life now then you have and we
know how little I get out

 The one that really stuck in my mind was explaining transitions in the panels of Watchmen Id
read Watchmen a short while before and appreciated its narrative complexity 
but not being used to reading comics hadnt registered all the technical
tricks that the artist was using to achieve this The post not only taught
me something about the grammar of such images but more importantly led to
me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place So
thanks a lot for that one

SEK I started going through your back posts and noticed a pattern in my
selections so I think it would be easier for me because i’m rubbish with
html to just say all the scene analysis posts and the close reading comics
posts like the one Magistra mentioned and many others after that Plus
Justifying Comics as a Legitimate Object of Study Parts I II I also
liked  Teaching the Overdetermined Image   Your takedown of Cashill and the
whole Ayers wrote Dreams was excellent and the Cruel cruel death post you
know what i’m talking about right  

Also The Day in Actual Communist and Real Nazi History seems as relevant
today as ever

Agree with the previous two comments I don’t remember if youve made noises
here before about turning these into a book but if you do youve got at
least one reader

Would it be possible to arrange your posts into three parties and give
your many readers the opportunity to vote for one of them by secret
ballot  I feel your British readers would appreciate that

The Internet occasionally reminds me of how different life is because of
it 

I noted on Facebook that from a statistical perspective what makes baseball such an
amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see on a daily basis 
something youve never seen before Its a truism I know but it has the benefit of actually
being true In this case the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel
Pagan hit an inside the park home run and initiate a triple play in the same game John Emerson responded with some humbug about it
not being an inside the park grand slam which made me remember that I had seen an inside the park grand slam at some time in the remote past 
I remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play the Cardinals in an
afternoon game at Shea Stadium and thanks to the miracle of the Internet I can definitively say that at approximately 
p m on June I watched Terry Pendleton hit an inside the park grand slam off Joe
Sambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily The fact that I can verify vague
memories of events that occurred twenty five years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget
the Internet is capable of doing 
This realization is obviously not of world historical importance merely a reminder that this
thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to
human memory The fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an elevator
with on December is less weird because I chose to write
about riding in an elevator with Grimace That I can access detailed information about
events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely 





Joe Sambito Wow Id completely forgotten about him I sometimes wish I could forget that
Pendelton is the Braves hitting coach Closest I came to that was watching Dale Murphy get
tagged out at the plate on what would have been an inside the park slam

He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets stayed for then he pitched for
the Red Sox against the Mets in World Series I remember him being ineffective and as it
turns out he was Now that I remember him which I didn’t before I remember him as
being the pitcher whod pitched for the team the Mets faced to get to the Series and 
the one they faced in it I didn’t remember that I remember that but now that I do I do 
Memory as Gertrude Stein would say is funny

Apparently the drug use sexual excess and weird UCI experiences havent softened your
brain yet 

Whats really bothersome though is when you only remember things from your distant
past 

My grandpa was alert till the end but when I last saw him at age everything he wanted to
talk about was years in the past

You know what makes this post great  No stinking cricket 
 Posted by tomemos   Wednesday May at PM 



Yeah I remember Sambito from the Astros when the Braves were in the old NL West because it
made sense to have a team miles from most of their division rivals Solid pitcher for a
while But burned out toward the end Apparently he is a players representative now

I like to read about others watching baseball more than I like to watch baseball by a factor
of nine Having given up on watching the actual sport mention of baseball now only sparks
memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers It is true that at the
end of time the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers as they
had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing but horrendous to watch in
person Plus they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes

The Anti Terrorist   Undermining The Motivation For Terrorism

BACKGROUND September 
 Three years have now gone by since the September th attacks in and terrorism is a far
greater threat to us now than it was then The number and severity of terrorist attacks
worldwide has increased dramatically as has the number of active terrorists Before   
terrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals loosely linked by radical
Islam and hatred of Israel and its sole supporter the USA Now many more moderate Muslims have
become radicalized world wide willing to kill innocent civilians in order to achieve their
purposes And the serious targets have expanded to include civilians in Russia India Maylasia 
the Philippines Spain and elsewhere as well as Israel and its sole supporter the United
States True the USA has not suffered a successful major attack since   but this does
not mean that we are safer The terrorists could strike any time they choose through any of
the numerous loopholes so well reported in our media But they have chosen not to attack 
perhaps because they are waiting to produce an effect even greater than the   attacks so
they do not appear to be losing strength What could be more spectacular than the   attacks 
Nuclear Or massive bio chemical attack And I think this is what they are waiting for All of
our frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing small time casual attacks but
they cannot stop a serious planned attack any more than a mere door lock can stop a serious
robber who really wants to get into your house So the Bush administration can keep
claiming that we are safer now under their policies But this claim is merely feel good
propaganda intended to keep the neo cons in power It cannot withstand clear headed scrutiny 
The fact is Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism much less defeat
it By trying to  stamp out  terrorism by killing terrorists Bush and Israel have made things
infinitely worse for us more dangerous not safer And proof that Bush has failed may come at
any moment explosively with one big successful attack here in the USA May God help
us all 
WHAT IS TERRORISM 
 TERRORISM is  the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a
population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective   Source Britannica com
http   www britannica com search query terrorism ct  We believe that any terrorist act
is a crime against humanity and against the will of God because it deliberately intends to
injure and kill innocent people 

NEUTRALIZING TERRORISM
 Our purpose here is to NEUTRALIZE TERRORISM by removing the motivation for it Without
motivation terrorism will quickly die down like a plant without water 
 We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force because brute
force radicalizes the moderates and they then join the terrorists So you end up fighting the
entire population Brute force has failed in Palestine and it is failing in Iraq 
 We try to be even handed in opposing all terrorism although we recognize that the greatest
terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that  
approves of their criminal behavior against Israel The United States Russia India the
Philippines Australia and others whom they falsely believe to be  waging war against    
And the second greatest terrorist threat comes from several countries mainly Israel who
sometimes resort to terrorism themselves claiming  self defense   as they desperately try to
prevent further attacks by radical Muslims In all of these cases above if the radical Muslims
would cease their attacks all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end 
 Beyond these two sources there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world with the
possible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic
episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups 

The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and
erroneous They need to be identified and attacked If the terrorist loses faith in the
righteousness of his acts he is less likely to perform them 


EXAMPLE  Terrorists
Offend    


EXAMPLE  Terrorist
Murderers Insult   Bring Shame To Islam 


EXAMPLE LATEST AND BEST 
  Framed Below  Quran Forbids Terrorism 


In every case of terrorism we will find some kind of legitimate underlying
grievance If we eliminate the legitimate grievances we have eliminated much of the
motivation 
 Is this  negotiating with terrorists  or  trying to appease the terrorists   as some
Israeli NeoCons would try to say  No It is simply recognizing the realities of human
motivation right or wrong To deny reality as the Israeli NeoCons do is to invite disaster 
as they have done

 Jet Lag Pathophysiology and Cures
 The longest Monday of my life
 
I recently returned to the US from Australia The  hour flight took me from Monday morning in Sydney to Monday
morning again in L A Crossing the date line messed up my sense of time enough without the added bonus of thinking I
should be heading to bed just as the sun began to climb into the California sky 

You may be familiar with the concept Jet lag The catch all name for circadian misalignment the disruption of sleep
cycles and circadian rhythms If youve had the pleasure of crossing time zones in a jet plane whether it was a mere
three hour hop from one coast of the US to the other or a trip to another continent chances are youve experienced
some amount of jet lag 

The pathophysiology of jet lag

Normally two systems  the homeostatic system and the circadian system  work together to produce a  hour sleep
cycle During the day the homeostatic system slowly accumulates a sleep drive a desire to sleep that increases as a
function of time spent awake The circadian system generates an alerting signal in opposition to this sleep drive 
which during the day keeps a person from feeling increasingly sleepy An hour or two before bedtime this signal
subsides and s he realizes its time to hit the pillow The sleep drive dissipates as a person sleeps and by morning
 assuming a full nights rest and possibly some coffee s he will be feeling alert and ready to go again 

Robert Sack wrote a delightful paper PDF on jet lag by the way which is
where i’m getting much of my information 

So weve got a nice cycle of sleep Jet lag is what happens when the homeostatic and circadian processes are
misaligned For example the circadian system may signal a person to be alert when its not actually morning or may be
reduced during daytime hours causing daytime sleepiness because the homeostatic sleep drive is no longer cancelled
out 

But I don’t want to be sleepy 

How do you beat jet lag  Robert Sack lists three primary approaches 


Reset the body clock
Prescribed sleep scheduling
Medication to counteract daytime sleepiness or insomnia



Lets start with the first one as it turns out to be the most complicated 

Resetting the body clock

The two most effective ways to reset the body clock are through bright light exposure and timed melatonin
administration 

Light is one of the most important cues about time of day and has the greatest effect on circadian timing much
smaller effects are seen from regular activities and meals for example Studies have shown that without light cues 
totally blind people tend to have free running circadian
rhythms with an average period of hours instead of the usual If a person is exposed to bright light early in
the day the persons internal clock is reset to an earlier time if exposure is instead in the evening the internal
clock is reset to a later time Brighter light has more of an effect such as the sun at to lux though
lower intensities e g   lux can produce changes 

Artificial light sources can be used to supplement daylight to help reset a persons internal clock to the correct
new time zone when traveling Alternatively a person could wear very dark glasses as light avoidance could help
minimize the problems of light exposure at the wrong time of day or night 

Resetting the body clock Part Melatonin

Melatonin is a hormone that has been linked to the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles
 PDF Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland at night secretion is suppressed by light exposure and as such the
hormone can be thought of as a  darkness signal   If doses of melatonin are administered in the morning circadian
rhythms will be shifted later evening doses shift rhythms earlier Timing of the doses is more important than amount
per dose though it remains to be seen what the optimal dose and optimal time of administration is  trials have been
done with doses from to mg at times ranging from three days before departure to five days after arrival in the
new time zone 

If doses of melatonin are combined with light exposure the results are what you might expect synergistic if both
are administered to produce a time shift in the same direction both earlier or both later antagonistic otherwise 

Sleep wake sleep wake

The second way to beat jet lag Sleep at weird times Slowly adjust your sleep schedule to match that of your
destination or keep your home sleep schedule for a while after you arrive The problem with this is that your
sleep wake schedule wont match up with that of the people around you and if you need to be awake for breakfast at am
or for a meeting in the afternoon your sleep schedule may interfere Use this method at your own risk 

Drugs for everything

Lastly we have sleep medicines As you might guess hypnotic medications combat insomnia and stimulants fight off
daytime sleepiness pretty well because by definition that’s what they do Both benzodiazepine and non benzodiazepine
drugs have been shown to be effective in the first case for the latter the most common solution is to consume more coffee PDF This works In the study
linked subjects were treated with slow release caffeine or with melatonin prior to a long eastward flight the caffeine
subjects were less sleepy than either melatonin or placebo Granted caffeine subjects also took longer to fall asleep
later and awoke more frequently but that may be a risk you have to take 

Lagging behind

Light melatonin drugs strange sleep schedules Of course the only solution that will always work is time The
homeostatic and circadian processes need to realign and while the aforementioned ways of beating jet lag can fast track
the process it still takes time 

UPDATE I was alerted by a friend of the existence further research of which I was
unaware Another way to reset your sleep wake cycle is to stop eating If you fast for about to hours your body clock will reset with whatever time
you break your fast as morning The Fuller Lu Saper paper
 PDF published in Science discusses the mechanism though a more recent paper argues that the Fuller et al results are inconclusive 
 
 


 
 
 Tibetan Buddhist Retreat

 
Faded squares of fabric strung together in repeating blue white red green yellow chains crisscross the branches of
bare limbed trees The gentle wind makes them flutter Orange gold light filters into the grassy meadow touching a row
of canvas tents and the temple house beyond Tsechen Kunchab Ling Temple of All Encompassing Great Compassion This is the seat of His Holiness
the Sakya Trizin in the United States a Tibetan Buddhist monastery established nine years ago 

I spent the past weekend there The field work office at my college arranges this retreat every semester Everyone
Ive talked to who has previously attended says wonderful things about it this semester one of my friends told me she
was going I should join her I like learning new things so I signed up A good decision I didn’t return all chill and
zen as one friend told me his roommate had but I certainly gained a few new ideas and approaches to mull over and
dipped my hand into a previously unfamiliar piece of the world 

Medicine for ones mind

The first evening the twenty something students  most from my college four from another  gathered in the shrine
room sitting cross legged on cushions as we listened to Khenpo Kalsang introduce Tibetan Buddhist philosophy He began
by telling us  Do not take any of what I say on faith Take it through analysis if there is some benefit in it for
you   Religion he said is like a drugstore full of medicine You do not go to the drugstore and buy everything in
it  you just buy what would be beneficial to you now You believe the other medicine may have just as much value but in
other situations not this one 

We discussed the foundations the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma the four noble truths karma defilements 
the six perfections When we talked about the giving and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient
beings in the form of material items kind words protection and so on Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha 
and how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat  So   a fellow student asked 
 Giving ones life for another being is the ultimate gift  

Khenpo Kalsang he smiled and shook his head  Only if you feel no regret   he said  If you feel regret it
destroys the merit   Until then preserve your own life and do not give away anything that would cause you regret This
struck a chord Self preservation above all else unless the right situation arises 

Knowing and understanding

Later I talked to the resident nun Ani Kunga about psychology and cognitive science She had studied psychology
for a while in grad school but now holds the view that psychologists are going about understanding the mind and
understanding the knower and what knowing is the wrong way  Psychologists   she said  study the brain and the self
externally Ever since the s their science has been about observation of behavior questionnaires recordings of
electrical brain activity But the mind can only be known by you the person whose mind it is   She said
philosophy and epistemology were doing it right looking at experiences from the inside 

A big overlap exists between Tibetan Buddhism psychology and cognitive science All three examine the distinction
between the self and others between the observer and the observed between knowing and the knower I agree with Ani
Kunga to some extent  only so much can be known about the mind from external observation But this doesn’t mean that
there isn’t merit to such studies nor that nothing of use can be learned in that way 

Tibetan Buddhist philosophy also approaches the mind and the self from the inside During a second philsophy session 
Khenpo Kalsang translated a sutra about a king who received advice from the Buddha This sutra delved into some
questions about the nature of the self whether the self is a delusion and how the clinging of self is a defilement I
intend to discuss it in more depth later so stay tuned 

Compassion training and prayer flags

In the afternoon a group of us gathered outside for a meditation session with Ani Kunga Sunshine melted lazily
through the tree branches above a breeze animating the branches shadows so they danced between our cushions 
Compassion and anger were the sessions topics The key message 

 If theres something you can do why are you unhappy  Just do it If theres nothing you can do why are you
unhappy  

Ani Kunga explained several off session and one on session technique for dealing with negative emotions anger hate 
irritation stress jealousy and so on All the methods built off the idea that you are in control anger is an
emotion and you can change your emotions Stay tuned for a more in depth post on the topic 

Another of the days activities was making prayer flags As Ani Kunga explained  Prayers wishes hopes 
aspirations  someone many people may share those with you Hanging the prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone
else in the world This may do no good at all but it may  if everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires perhaps
it will do good It may not But if no one shares their prayers it will certainly do no good 
So on the offchance that it will help why not  

Never done

This weekend reminded me that i’m not done learning If I stay still long enough if i’ve achieved a relatively
constant level of happiness and satisfaction I forget that I can and should continue to seek out new ideas and
approaches and incorporate beneficial ones into my life A person is never  done   and so Ill continue to observe and
discuss and study trying to pick the directions in which Ill change and trying to make tomorrow better than
today 

Ever onward and ever upward 
 
 


 
 
 Self control Self efficacy and New Years Resolutions
 Unresolved
 
Im not one to make New Years resolutions 

I mean sure I could take my pick of popular New Years resolutions I could decide on the
first day of the new year that this year Ill start exercising more and eating better or that Ill spend more time
with my family and friends or that Ill learn a new skill And if I chose to make resolutions Id be far from alone  a
 survey on Dorthy com found that of the   adults polled
had made resolutions at some point though only managed to keep them 

Making resolutions Its about self control

The question Anirban Mukhopadhyay of the Hong Kong University and Gita Venkatarmani Johar of the Graduate School of
Business at Columbia University asked is this What determines how many goals a person will set and
how successful a person will be at achieving those goals  They performed a few studies in to look at the
relationship between self control goal setting and goal achievement They suggested that what you believe about self control affects the
goals you set and achieve PDF 

In the paper  self control  is used to mean a sense of willpower Mukhopadhyay Venkatarmani discuss various
lay theories of self control noting that the amount of self control a person has can be seen as either an inherently
limited or unlimited resource and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed the amount of
self control a person has can change over time or not An important premise to note here is the idea that the
probability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained So if you
think youll be able to achieve a goal you’re more likely to set it Combine this with theories of self control and in
general if you believe you have unlimited stores of self control youll set a larger number of goals If you believe
self control is malleable but limited youll set fewer goals 

Mukhopadhyay Venkatarmani also discuss self efficacy belief in ones capabilities the perceived ability to
carry out a desired action They propose that people with high self efficacy  people who believe that failure is the
result of insufficient effort and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence  will achieve more of their goals
than people with low self efficacy who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability and thus may simply
give up 

The studies

In the first study participants all college students each read one of four passages presenting lay theories of
self control Each passage contained two paragraphs the first discussed self control either as limited or as unlimited 
and the second discussed self control as either malleable or fixed The participants then answered questions about their
belief in each of two theories presented followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation in which they listed
all their current goals 

The study was testing whether a belief in unlimited malleable self control would result in most resolutions and
indeed this is what was found The experimenters had some concerns about participants natural beliefs in relation to
the passages they read however so in study two the order of the two measures lay theories and motivation goal
listing was varied Data from new participants revealed that as hypothesized if the motivation goals
questionnaire were assessed first then among the people who believed self control is malleable those who also believed
self control to be unlimited vs limited set more goals When lay theories were assessed first this result reversed 
The people who believed that self control is fixed were unaffected by order 

The third study moved on to examine goal achievement adding a measure to look at self efficacy The study had two
sessions in November then February In the first session the participants read passages about lay theories much
like in study one but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation listed the resolutions they were planning
on making at New Years rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions and filled out
individual difference measures which included a self efficacy scale Only participants successfully returned for
the second session during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions 

What does this mean for your resolutions 

The resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar take a look at any list of
popular New Years resolutions and youll see the majority of the goals As shown in the first two studies more goals
were set by people who believe self control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people  that is if you expect
more success you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself Self efficacy did not have
a significant effect on goal setting 

As far as success goes only the interaction between lay theory and self efficacy was significant If participants
believed in limited self control and were low in self efficacy they tended to give up more often failing to achieve
their goals But if participants believed in unlimited self control self efficacy had no effect participants achieved
just as many goals regardless and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed 

Mukhopadhyay Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay
theories of self control and beliefs about ones own amount of self control and self efficacy and propose this as an
area for future study But in general lay theories about self control can determine how much success youll expect and
thus how many goals youll set and self efficacy beliefs can determine how much success youll actually have

 Varsity athletics Credit or no 

 
Its a matter of balance
 
Vassars varsity athletes may soon receive academic credit for participating in
their sports during the school year This proposal has been in the works for nearly two years and at long last 
folks are voting to approve it Or to not approve it but the former seems more likely 

As a member of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee and as a long time varsity athlete you might say I have
particular stake in the proposal After all I could get half a unit a semester for up to four semesters  a typical
class is worth one unit and a typical physical education course of any level is worth half a unit with a maximum of
two physical education units counting toward graduation requirements It seems justified Students can receive credit
for participating in other extracurricular faculty supervised activities such as the orchestra the choir and the
repertory dance theatre so why not varsity athletics 

My friend over at Carolyn Blogs agrees from the above standpoint sure it seems fair to give credit to
students If you get credit for introductory P E classes you should get credit for varsity athletics But our
school newspaper presents other arguments in favor which Carolyn thinks are highly unjustified 

On top of everything we must remember that varsity athletics present a considerable time commitment It is rare to
find another activity on campus academic or extracurricular that includes a comparable daily rigor and frequent
overnight obligation Varsity athletes regularly travel throughout the northeastern to participate in meets games and
tournaments often gone from campus for an entire weekend at a time 

And you know what  Although its certainly frustrating to travel to Boston for an all day competition on the same
weekend as a good friends birthday party a fascinating sounding lecture a dance party and seventeen other campus
events no one in their right mind would ever want to miss I agree with Carolyn The reason I participate in my sport is
because I enjoy it If I cared more about other activities Id do those instead Simply being a huge time commitment is
not a valid reason for awarding credit Carolyns supporting example that higher level courses with more difficult and
plentiful homework are worth the same amount of credit as introductory  level courses drives this point home And
shes backed up by our schools system of awarding units
instead of credit hours 

This system which in its most basic form allots one unit of credit per semester course regardless of difficulty 
hours in class and subject matter makes Vassar relatively unique in its credit system 

According to Registrar Dan Giannini The rationale behind such a system is to try to send the message that all
courses are equal in worth and that one shouldnt try to distinguish between courses based on time spent in or out of
class

The reason time commitment is highlighted is because according to the authors of the article the faculty  must
consider what it can do to mitigate possible academic pressures on these students   Um No I don’t think the faculty
has any obligation whatsoever Students choose to be varsity athletes of their own accord If they cant manage to
balance their athletics and their coursework then perhaps they should reconsider participating in a varsity sport in
the first place Athletes shouldnt get special privileges simply because theyre athletes 

Personally I like the fact that even though I dedicate huge chunks of time to my sport more time than
I dedicate to any single course at least while in season I can still keep up with my classmates who are taking
comparable course loads minus the sport Sacrifices must be made sure Dance party on Friday night or overnight
travel to a competition  

The question is whats more important to me 

You learn stuff too

The article continues 

 While athletes will continue to be held to the Colleges rigorous academic standards the athletics credit could
discourage a varsity athlete from unnecessarily taking on five academic credits while in their athletic season 

With the proposed varsity credit the athlete seeking to assume five courses in his or her athletic season will be
checked with an overload form thus encouraging the student to think twice about assuming such a large academic and
extracurricular load 

Id like to be known that students who have trouble balancing tough course loads and time consuming extracurriculars
have always had the option of taking a lighter load or dropping an extracurricular Adding the option of a
varsity unit to the list doesn’t make much of a difference Students who arent varsity athletes could add an easy P E 
course instead Students who can balance their work and their sport will continue to do so And let it be known varsity
athletes don’t have to take a half unit for their sport thus negating the need for an overload form if
taking five courses 

Carolyn says in response to the above quote that  participating in sports is optional and should always take
second place to academics   True mostly Academics are officially what college is about Academics are what get graded 
Students GPAs will in part determine what they are able to do with their lives But academics are only one particular
kind of knowledge Carolyns statement assumes that a student can learn more important things from academics than from
participation on a sports team Personally though some of the most important things i’ve learned about persistence 
goal setting success and excellence effort teamwork leadership these i’ve learned from my sport and my coaches 
Its a different kind of knowledge than what one typically gains in an academic course yes But its no less important 
And that I think is the best reason for awarding credit for varsity athletics 
 
 





Detroit and the Myth of the House   Uprooted an eco travel
blog



 Americas Rust Belt is a swath of cities and towns that boomed during the
Industrial Era and now lie    well rusting    as empty remainders of glory days
past 
Chief among these is Detroit Motor City The longtime center of American
automotive manufacturing was gutted when the Big Three car companies
simultaneously failed 

Detroit already plagued by corruption and crime saw its unemployment rate
skyrocket in 

Whats left behind when an economy collapses  Cheap real estate that’s what 

Id read a New
York Times article about some forward thinking artist types who bought a house in Detroit for Some of us
 and lots of New Yorkers pay that much in rent every month 
In fact the article went on soon a nearby house went on the market for 
The artist types notified their buddies who moved in post haste 
I was intrigued Really  A house  Even if it was a real
fixer upper even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in
it thatd still be a hell of a deal Why out in New Mexico where you can
still buy unincorporated land with no water or roads youd pay at least 
for a house sized plot of dust So how can you buy an actual home for   that’s literally cheaper than dirt 

The possibilities of this were fascinating I had visions of hipsters from coast
to coast converging in Detroit building a new city on rock roll I pictured
young artists owning homes fixing up neighborhoods I saw community gardens 
art parks a grassroots transformation of a city We could take that oil stained
soil and those rusted factories and create something new and beautiful With
houses going for I thought what would you have to lose
by moving to Detroit 
And so Quiet Earp and I did some research and came up with a list of houses
selling for under a grand We had plenty to choose from there were more cheap
houses than we would have time to visit We picked two neighborhoods to cruise 
and dove in 
But once we entered Detroit the truth hit fast this is a modern American ghost
town The place is practically deserted Its streets built wide to accommodate
heavy traffic are mostly empty Houses and businesses are boarded up painted
up bombed out and falling down Even in the center of the business district 
theres no traffic and hardly any people 
Dont believe me  I videotaped it 

It got worse as we drove into residential areas looking for those cheap houses 
In fact i’ve never felt so out of place in all my life 
Even in Chicagos South Side where we counted five white people in an hour I
felt fine just driving around not so in Detroit Truthfully it wasn’t about
race it was about being naive It was about driving down streets where we truly
did not belong and were not welcome 

Detroit is a ghost town and its inhabited by ghosts the only people left here
are those who cant or wont leave They live in deserted neighborhoods in
houses with collapsed front steps and missing windows They sit on the porch and
watch the cars go by watch the deals go down watch their neighborhoods
crumble And we driving through slowly and reading house numbers in a
late model Honda stuck out like a couple of thumbs 
So we sped up and went straight to the houses Sometimes we stopped to take a
photo but mostly we didn’t Earp and I have each lived happily in the wilds of
West Oakland but the danger I felt in Detroit was like nothing Id experienced
before I was actually afraid for my life 

The New York Times correspondent wrote that his friend Mitchs home  had
already been stripped of its appliances and wiring But for Mitch that only
added to its appeal because he now had the opportunity to renovate it with
solar heating solar electricity and low cost high efficiency appliances  
As for the house  It  needed some work a hole patched some windows
replaced  
Well I don’t know what part of Detroit these folks live in but the houses
I saw looked more like this 

You see abandoned houses in this town get set on fire No exceptions Wherever
we went in those neighborhoods one in four houses had been torched On one
corner we saw a giant banner hung across a charred front porch We didn’t slow
down to take a photo but Ill paraphrase don’t BURN
HOUSES DOWN DETROIT POLICE ARE WATCHING YOU 
Except that they obviously arent People who live in this part of town are on
their own And although I and many others would love to own even a fire scarred 
condemned building the fact is that we would’nt  last a week here Buy a 
house in Detroit and you get a lifetime supply of sleepless nights youll
spend the next several years waiting for burglars and arsonists murderers and
crackheads to break in the windows 
Its like the Wild West without the scenery the gold and the hope Its the
Rust Belt 

Ultimately I do believe that change will come to Detroit There
will be a green movement here in fact its already being cultivated by
forward thinking
groups and 
intrepid locals One day this place will be reborn 
But right now the NYTs story reeks of Shinola 
Truth is any artist type who moves into this part of Detroit is
probably pretty handy with a pistol or a shotgun Anyone who takes this
plunge is risking their life every day betting on a future that may take a long
time to arrive 


Long story short Yes you can buy a house in Detroit
for And you will get what you pay for 

Cheers to Toby Barlow who inspired my trek to Detroit and who believes in a
happier greener future May your every dream come true sir and your book
sell fabulously

Great post Thank you for this info I need that


 Myself Sep at am 

Please track down and watch a movie called  Detroit A City to Yourself  by
Nicole MacDonald Its full of this imagery and talks about the fire
and rebuilding and the post industrial devastation that’s ravaged the city
since 
Most poignantly it talks about Hurricane Katrina which focused attention on
rebuilding another city with this level of devastation and how without a
single catastrophic event to blame for it Detroits decay has gone
unsympathetically ignored 
The movie wraps up by observing this how abandoned buildings and spaces are
being reclaimed by nature About the pop fiction which explores the concept
of a post human world and how it already exists now And about how if
youre a pheasant that’s not such a bad thing 
HOWEVER 
Theres a lot more to Detroit than that There are industrial spaces being
turned into low rent artist lofts and business incubators Look at the
Russell Industrial Complex for one example There are neighborhoods that
refuse to cave west of Livernois around McNichols Theres a whole bunch
of nice stuff happening along the riverfront from downtown up towards Stroh
Place 
And theres always Belle Isle When friends come to Detroit I take them
there Its our in the river park acres of green space with a zoo a
botanical garden and conservatory rentable paddle boats and tons of other
neat stuff Next time you’re in Detroit please head over Oh and entry is
free so its available to anyone regardless of economic status Youre
liable to see families picnicking bums gathering bottles and cans geese
foraging and deer cautiously wandering the edge of the woods Within a
hundred yards of each other 
Some of that cheap real estate isn’t too horrible either Theres a whole
street being taken over by artists Farnsworth between Moran and McDougall 
Some of the things theyve done down there are amazing and the community
garden is a great bridge to the surrounding neighborhood A few weeks ago 
someone broke into their shed to steal their garden tools Think about that
for a moment hoes and shovels don’t have enough pawn value to be worth
carrying out Whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own
garden 
Yes Detroits got more than its share of bad spots you’re right i’ve lived
in the metro area my whole life and there are areas I cant call them
neighborhoods down there where I don’t feel safe in daytime much less at
night But there are bright spots and behind every one of them is a person 
or a bunch of people who refuse to give up 


 Jessica Sep at am

Myself    Thanks for the comment and the great information You are exactly
the kind of person who gives me back the hope I lost on my way into town 
Seems theres a pretty solid group of Detroit residents who are truly
committed to restoring the city and that’s beautiful to see 
Love the fact that people are stealing garden implements though its still
sad that they need to 
I will absolutely watch A City To Yourself thank you for the recommendation 
And when i’m in the area again Ill go out to Belle Isle and think
long hard about the future of American cities  as i’m sure you do
occasionally too

Well growing up not far from Detroit myself I would point out a few
things 
 Driving a Honda in Detroit right now probably isn’t really going to get
you welcomed with open arms See theres a wee bit of loyalty to the Big 
and driving a foreign car doesn’t really scream  solidarity  to those
struggling to survive Most of the funny looks you got were less about your
color than about your ride You think i’m kidding but I couldnt be more
serious    that Honda is a visceral reminder for people of how the American
consumer has left Detroit in the dust 
 Detroit proper has been dying for a long time    before the riots 
even Its going to take some pioneering individuals to start creating those
pockets of innovation creativity and vision But its not going to happen
with the investment of into a single house Someone will need to begin
by creating an urban  oasis  that mitigates some of the fears that you had
while driving through the city    where to buy groceries a place where you
can feel safe on your own front porch the freedom to sleep soundly without
worrying about your copper wiring 
 For all that is wrong with Detroit    and that’s nearly everything   
youd be astonished by the pride that Detroiters have for their city They
lack the means to build her back to her former glory but she wont be
abandoned For all of those who are trapped there by their circumstances 
there are just as many who insist that they would’nt  live anywhere else

Thank you for the opportunity to see post BushCo era Detroit through the
prism of your vision 
Ive never been there but ever since that mad possessed American History
Professor I had i’ve been haunted by Detroit No even before that    
The Dollmaker has often been called Americas least pretentious
masterpiece Joyce Carol Oates in the NYTBR 
When folks like Gertie Nevels and Levon Helm and John Hiatt and my favorite 
John Henry left the mountains to go wrestle with the Industrial leviathan
in Detroit they were in it to the death Detroit wont be the death of the
courage of those early Detroit pioneers it looks like Nature will prevail
after all Everybody wins 
I love what you are doing

Is this the monument left behind for the world to witness by Corporatism 
Capitalism  Is this the greatness they built on earth  Is this the proof
that all countries deserve democracy and its inevitable cancers corporatism
and capitalism  We die in war to bring this to other countries  This 
American Glory  In a class less society  This is the final phase the
crowning glory of Americas greatness  Does this show our systems
superiority over the commies in China  The old Soviet Guard  Europes
follies  Have we really built a  Great Society  or is that all propaganda   
Bull Shiite to hush free thought eyes to the flag while our pockets and
resources were raided by shysters spin meisters schmucks and banksters 
Did we build sane sustainable survival shelter homes  Do we still have
fertile backyard gardens filled with the composting of the age  Can any of
what we built be recovered restored renovated into useful shelter  Did
the tools of production really get sold to the shareholders benefit 
leaving the worker without means to defend himself  Have the great fortunes
earned in trust as  American  for American investment here in America 
really migrated to the Beijing Shanghai and Hang Seng markets converted
to safer  Yuan  and invested in Chinas wealth  Did this really happen to
American patriots  Do you still love democracy corporatism capitalism and
all it has done for you  Are you really  Free   Is Conscription just around
the corner to serve Halliburton Dubai in attaining pipeline clearance
through Afghanistan to Turkmenistan and the oil field there  Are American
lives well spent in thei  Middle East  endevor  Are we just mercenaries for
big oil not liberators spreading  Freedom   Is this really just flag waving
propaganda  What exactly did we win in Iraq  Cheaper Oil  I think not 
Gratitude of a Free nation  I think not Why has the  Rust Belt  come into
being  What were we doing  Where did the great society for all the one we
were told we were building go  Japan  China  To the Uber Rich  As we sink
into our own ruins the dark horse rides on America The dark horse rides
on Sad

this They have the unmidas touch Every decaying city in America has Ds

When you said you were naive you werent kidding 


 Jessica Reeder Oct at pm 
Nope I wasn’t kidding Put it in writing didn’t I 
Lumpy i’m not a Democrat and I don’t much approve of the Democratic Party 
Just so were clear on that I don’t think you present a fully informed
argument on the causes of urban decay but I don’t disagree with you 
Im not particularly interested in whose fault this mess is rather I choose
to focus on how were going to clean it up that’s where the green movement
comes in and when I say  green  i’m talking plants not politics 
If youve got some fancy new technology at Boeing that can do more for
peoples health and happiness and for less cost than a victory garden can
do please let me know

Last I checked greed sloth hubris and waste were all pretty universally
human traits and I see no halos around either Libertarians Dems or even
anarchically green at heart 
I agree    Democrats like country music have disappointed me too many times
in the past for me to keep on listening But here’s the thing    frogs are
mutating due to the planet trying to kill itself Salmon have forgot how to
screw Otters in post Valdez Alaska are clawing their own
petro chemical burned eyes out in pain 
The patient is earth and its not getting better You want to yell at which
insurance company fucked up or change a bedpan so to speak  During times
of crisis which this is the ones who will create positive change are
those who accept the hand they are dealt and act The ones who are educated
and informed and attached to delegating moral judgements will be perfectly
equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists Just ask the
Palestinians who left after the first war to cry over the past Or ask my
Paiute grandfather Or even Friend Salmon who still haunts my dreams and
tells me not to let us blow each others asses off the earth until we clean
up the mess we have made 
 That was for Lumpy Nobody gets laughed at alone in my presence

I find this topic fascinating I was born in a suburb of Detroit and most of

take a Daytime tour of these decaying areas especially the old factories 
I have the urban explorer fascination However the main reason I wanted to
post was to say to  Lumpy   the democrats have the unmidas touch  LMAO 
that is classic and I must agree with Lumpy Freaking hillarious and so
true Thanks Lump man BTW great blog and great info Peace 


 Brad Oct at pm 
I too checked out a few listings for under and was absolutely shocked
at the property taxes A house which could be fixed up into maybe a
   house comes with a tax bill of   K per year The taxes on my
 K house in an urban area of Mississippi are only  year 
Additionally even if you paid cash for the house youd probably want to
carry some homeowners insurance with all the inherent risks to the property
 arson vandalism and i’m sure its sky high given those risks

I heard this same accusation on Kos today that the audience is laughing AT Christine
O’Donnell on the first thing she says but I disagree entirely On THAT point HER supporters
are laughing at COONS its absolutely a  She’s got YOU DUMBASS   laugh the sort of
 Oh No She DIINT   laugh you’d hear from a studio audience when the slightly stupid but
affable and hitherto ineffective Dunce Character finally gets a zinger in on the Handsome
Lead 

Remember that at least half the audience in a venue like this would be there to support
O’Donnell and the  Point to Separation of Church and State in the Constitution  dig
is a virulently popular meme in the loonosphere from whence comes the Teabagger Political
Playbook Those are hoots and calls of SUPPORT for O’Donnell supposedly putting one over on
Coons they aren’t laughing at her 

There may very well have been a gasp and some uncomfortable  Okay that’s enough now 
chuckles at the end but the guffaws at the top of the clip are WITH her not AT her

Hilarious 
Posted by at October PM


I don’t think the audience is laughing at Coons the laughter has an incredulous oh my god
sound to it But its obvious that O’Donnell thinks they’re laughing at him not her When she
hears the reaction she looks out at the audience with a big proud grin She thinks she just
scored mucho points on Baldy 

Elding is right  separation of church and state isn’t in the Constitution  is a major
wingnut talking point They routinely claim that the establishment of religion clause does’nt
mean what everyone else thinks it means So although this shows what an extremist nut
O’Donnell is its not really a gaffe its standard stuff right out of their playbook 
Posted by Steve at October PM


Well if one is looking for the phrase  Separation of Church and State   yeah 
That’s not in there so TADA Yay Looks at me I wins a big arguments and I poops my pants 
But the principle is in there I love when ignorant fucks like O’Donnell and her little
orcling hordes make huge category mistakes like this Its is akin to taking a tour of a
college and starting it off at the administration offices and when that part of the tour is
finished someone like O’Donnell says Ok that’s great but when are we gonna start seeing
the college  

Posted by at October PM



Yes its standard stuff and HER CROWD would have spring boarded OFF of it that’s what I’m
saying As far as she’s concerned its not a gaffe and as far as HER SUPPORTERS in the room
are concerned it was not only NOT a gaffe it was a Direct Hit They should have applauded 
that would have settled this matter for good I’m convinced that’s not laughing at her that’s
 Ooo good one   FOR her 
Posted by ELDING at October PM


Well ELDING its already being reported that it was HER that was clueless so Coons gets the
last laugh on that 
Posted by  at October PM


I don’t believe this was a public event Elvis I think it was a debate before the students
at the law school I mean it could be some of her supporters infiltrated but I truly believe
there would’ve been lots of catcalling etc if that were the case 
Posted by pea at October PM


Yeah Pea you have a point there but still The laughter does’nt sound incredulous to me 
it sounds appreciative and snarky Put yourself in a non partisan Law School Student position 
Would you laugh at loud at a Teabagger Meme like the one she dropped or would you
mutter grumble to yourself whispering to your colleague  What a fucking idiot   I don’t see
a crowd like that laughing out loud at such a pitiful little meme its not even worth a
laugh out loud guffaw 
Posted by ELDING at October PM


well keep in mind that all of them probably know what a freak she is I think it might be
more of a  holy crap I cant believe she just topped all the other stupid shit she’s said 
and I got to bear witness to it   laughter I know if I had the opportunity to attend a Sarah
Palin rally Id be overjoyed to hear some incredible stupid falling out of her mouth

which would be uh ANY Sarah Palin rally Also

the debate was at a LAW SCHOOL You really think lawyers are going to laugh at Coons rather

Not a snowballs chance in hell 
Posted by Nicole at October PM


Excerpts from http   tiny url com  

 You actually audibly heard the crowd gasp Widener University political scientist Wesley
Leckrone said after the debate adding that it raised questions about O’Donnells grasp of the
Constitution 

Erin Daly a Widener professor who specializes in constitutional law said that while there
are questions about what counts as government promotion of religion there is little debate
over whether the First Amendment prohibits the federal government from making laws
establishing religion 

 She seemed genuinely surprised that the principle of separation of church and state derives
from the First Amendment and I think to many of us in the law school that was a surprise  
Daly said  Its one thing to not know the th Amendment or some of the others but most
Americans do know the basics of the First Amendment  

O’Donnell didn’t respond to reporters who asked her to clarify her views after the
debate  
Posted by Big Ben at October PM



Anyone who says  Evolution is only a THEORY its not a fact  is so stupid so utterly
fucking brainless uneducated ignorant clueless and unread they should immediately be
sterilized on the slim chance that there’s a genetic component to their imbecility 
Anyone who stubbornly knows so little about science cannot possibly be expected to develop the
analytical skills necessary to interpret Con Law

If the laughter was with her then the joke is on everyone there in support of course 
because moments later after she’s basically pounding the desk talking about the constitution
and her unyielding devotion to that which does not separate church and state ha ha she cant
recall the and the amendments and needs to be refreshed by the questioner 

That’s the real  busted   moment here if you ask me 

For people who speak so militantly about adhering to the constitution I expect a military
like response to such a simple question 

Wingnuts will turn blue arguing about a Christian nation and constitution but not knowing
two amendments as a person running to uphold and defend the constitution containing those
amendments this clip exposes her and the Tea Party faithful as constitutional frauds 

Not knowing what the constitution says when asked is bold font black over white There’s no
grey area here 

As a defender you can say  well she believes church and state are indivisible so do I  
But you cant say she knows the constitution when she clearly does not 

As someone trying to get a government job with great benefits where the qualification is
basically  take this constitution and defend it with your life   Tea Party Republicans spend
an awful lot of time tearing it up and reassembling the pieces to their acquired tastes 

Her argument dismissing the separation of church and state is dessert before dinner 

Slightly off topic i’ve been spending a lot of time on potential swing vote forums adding
fact to fiction Its hilarious when republicans who voted for Bush twice and approved the
majority of the way through approval among republicans was pretty consistent are telling me
about all the mistakes Obama makes and imparting their Bush loving  wisdom  to those less
in the know 

If you think Bush was good enough to vote for twice and you’re one of the million
McCain Palin people your qualifications and insight like Christine O’Donnells are comical
at best 

Make no mistake I’m laughing AT you Tea Party Republican people

Its beyond frustrating to me as someone who has studied Constitutional Law who competed on
the national level on it in law school and who published an article on it to hear people
who clearly have’nt done the first of these talk about it as if they know better than I do what
the Constitution says means and is all about 

I had a over at tell me I did’nt know what I was talking about vis à vis the need
for Constitutional interpretation and Constitutional Law he believed that any and all
Constitutional questions must and can only be resolved by Amendment not
by judicial review before proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and
 despise d the legal profession   

Where do you go from there 
Posted by at October PM


I thinks this illustrates their biblical view of the Constitution and by that I mean they
regard it the same way as they regard the Holy Bible Its a document that is not to be
questioned but merely followed to the letter because it was handed down to us by greater
beings Oh and like the Holy Bible that we mere mortals are not supposed to question or
interpret they’ll let us know what it really means and that will often conflict with
what it actually says 

They try to exert some sort of control over its meaning by elevating it to a level that
makes it untouchable To them it’s not a living document that was designed to change with the
nation but essentially carved in stone like the Ten Commandments Immutable and unchanging 
Except for you know maybe an amendment barring gay marriage But in order to regain some
control over their lives that they firmly believe they’ve lost they’re now trying to
determine with unwavering certainty that we’ve all been doing this wrong the whole time and
if we just get back to what the founders wanted everything will be ok

In answer to your question    where do you go from there  I’ve recently come to the
conclusion that the answer is  nowhere  I used to be against making blanket statements about
the hard core tea partiers like the person you described  they’re not all crazy   they’re
not all hateful  but lately I’m over it 

 they don’t believe in evolution climate change the dept of education public education 
taxes in order to pay for roads police and firemen they believe the President is not an
American they see no problem with racism sexism and fascism they don’t understand that
 freedom of speech  does’nt mean freedom from consequences they confuse losing an election
with tyranny they horde food because glenn beck told them so    they conflate their  movement 
with the civil rights movement   they  detain  reporters on public property for the crime of
asking questions 

you don’t reason with people who believe these things any more than you’d try to reason with

 ELDING   Have to disagree buddy The debate was at Widener Law School They laughed at her
the second time as well when she incredulously asked as if not believing Coons  That’s in the
First Amendment  

I don’t think they were laughing at him If they were they’d be reacting after his comment
 and probably booing and calling him a liar rather than reacting after her comment

I had a over at tell me I didn’t know what I was talking about vis à vis
the need for Constitutional interpretation and Constitutional Law he believed that any and all
Constitutional questions must and can only be resolved by Amendment not by judicial review 
before proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and  despise d the legal
profession   

There is nowhere to go with these ignoramuses They would not believe you if you parted the
sea for them first I learned my lesson at HP While it can be personally satisfying to present
all your little ducks in a row they will never stop erroneously knocking the damn ducks out of
line

You know she had better watch out The separation between church and state is what saves us
from SHARIA LAW I think those trying to diminish the separation are probably secret Muslim
sympathizers that are sneaking SHARIA LAW in on us

Nah I’m convinced that the audible gasps and stifled chuckles were from her attempt to bluff
her way through an exchange regarding the Constitution in a room full of lawyers 

Performance art people 

She’s not running to win and if you think she is you’re not paying attention

Think of those Bill Maher clips The constant television appearances for the last decade or
so Think of who endorsed her and how O’Donnell could teach her a thing or two
about moderate ad 

The strategy is this be as foolish as possible so no one anticipates you actually knowing
anything Embrace the derision and or ridicule Go on the circuit as a passionate advocate for
whatever cause you choose to co opt In O’Donnells case its the same pseudo Christianity
holy rollers dignify to play within the political arena In Palins case its the
crypto fascism that oozes within the GOP The fool no one with their talk of
independence and the theatrical in fighting They always tame those they let in their ranks or
they destroy them Palin knows her place as do they all 

Do you really think a serious candidate would go around asking for hints during a debate 
Seriously O’Donnell is not that stupid I know some of you want to think she is for the sake
of mirth and merriment but she ain’t Sorry Just like Palin isn’t stupid enough to confuse
PA with WV Poke fun all you want but at least be realistic with yourselves you have just as
much fun as they’re having 

Trust me y’all they are faking it 

O’Donnells running on personality alone nothing more nothing less Regarding politics 
She’s a glorified booster same as with Mangle in Nevada Lowden the chicken lady and Mangle
were merely supposed to challenge and beat Reid then get out of the way O’Donnell is to be a
face for the underdog teabaggers This is why they’re not making a full investment in her Her
place is not in the senate but on television

Elvis having watching the video several times I have to disagree The audience was clearly
laughing at her and her ignorance However she clearly thinks she that she has scored a huge
win and that the audience was on her side 

Just more of her complete separation from reality

Oh and ELDING their reaction stems from the fact that she broached the subject again after
the moderator moved on Her question was the equivalent of asking  Where’re the pictures  
when staring at the document especially in that setting 

She did it on purpose not to further the discussion but to establish that yes she is a
dependable dumbass 

I’m telling you all she’s running a game 
Posted by at October PM


 I have to disagree with your assessment that this is all a game and that she’s not
that dumb I don’t believe she’s as dumb as she is ignorant It if really is a game for
O’Donnell then what’s the end game  She may have flown under the radar for her previous
campaigns but now she’s made herself a fool in the national spotlight and effectively ruined
any chance of continuing her charade if her intention was to be a lifelong nominee in the
first place 

Being a perpetual campaigner can only get you so far and if they don’t intend to win after
getting the nomination then that con game is limited 

Maybe Palin fits more into the realm of your assessment but if she runs and loses in 
her shelf life is limited too

BC you misunderstand me I’m not saying she knows a damned thing about the Constitution In
fact Id go a far as to say she doesn’t give one damn about it What I’m saying is that going
into these discussions she’s fully aware of her deficiencies To tell the truth I cant tell
you her actual  endgame   per se but if I had a guess it would be an extended stint on a
cable news channel 

The  shelf life  of both women is only limited to the fraction with which they uphold a
standard Palin took standards out of the equation when she quit her job Were she to actually
run it would be for vanity’s sake She’s reaching for what O’Donnell has already achieved 
They’ve both lowered themselves to being cheerleaders for so called  conservative  causes 
Well Palin did anyway 

I attribute part of my assessment of O’Donnell to info I’ve gleaned from a good friend of
mine that knew her on the media circuit at the start of the decade My friend describes her as
a  bad actress  primarily that co opts  conservativism   but doesn’t necessarily cling to it
as some may believe This friend tells me that Christine doesn’t believe half provocative
and or boneheaded things she’s saying  O’Donnell is described as a normal conservative
Republican woman by my friend I am convinced personally that  O’Donnells just a starved media
personality that found a new gimmick in running for public office That is the lifestyle
choice she has made and she’s sticking with it Some of the innuendo surrounding her leads me
to this conclusion as well However I cant be too conclusive 

You know what i’m being too much of a stuffy doctor 

Anyway that smile she gives after asking about the st Amendment may very well be her being
in on the joke she’s making of herself Its not the fact that she tried and failed to dictate
content within a Constitutional Amendment its the fact that she knew she did not know and
said what she said regardless Do not try to make sense out of anything of this if you’re not
thinking like a celebrity of whatever quality let’s say 

Heres what you do gather all the  O’Donnell appearances that you can from online sources 
Go through all and see if her point of view EVER evolves beyond the conservative blather or
the crank conspiracy theories Next ask yourself why she continues to be invited to these
public forums What exactly is she adding to these conversations  In all my cable news
watching i’ve seen far more dim characters than  O’Donnell with regular gigs so its not the
fact that she’s dumb that gets her on television My friend tells me of certain connections
individuals like  O’Donnell have that gets them the leeway they need to raise their public
profile Since they really have no one to answer to they can go on television and say
anything get away with it and do it again in yet another televised venue Its a perpetual
cycle she’s not campaigning to win anything i’m telling you BC 

You see how Rove immediately rejected her I don’t believe that was because she beat the
 establishment  candidate In fact my theory is that Rove wasn’t so much as rejecting her as
limiting her role within the media environment i’m thinking she’s aiming to be on FNC on a
regular basis This all comes from my observing her debate performances as well as her more
recent TV appearances she’s not so much running for office as she is auditioning to be a
regular voice for the Cons A reaffirmation of sorts she’s been at this for a while and they
have younger more loopier and dim witted Con tarts traipsing about Palins taking time away
from them but she has her own plans which have yet to be revealed though they may be all
too obvious 
Posted by Lexaburn at October AM
Christine  O’Donnell is certainly ignorant in the sense that while perfectly aware that
there are many things she doesn’t know she is clueless as to how that might be an
impediment Its an odd combination   knowing you don’t really have a solid grasp on a
subject but still being convinced that ones core principals are enough to overcome any
obstacle 

 O’Donnell believes in the bible she’s a Jesus freak And that’s enough for her 

 O’Donnell is opposed to anything liberal anything progressive anything Obama anything
Democrat anything that can in any way be determined NOT to accord with the demands of her
savior and lord jesus christ as SHE interprets his word in any way And that’s enough
for her The only reason she’s a Republican   Tea Party gangster is because her brand of
theocracy and batshit stupidity would simply never fly anywhere else In the stumped 
frustrated hypocritcal idiocy of the extreme right   in that gang of redneck ignoramuses who
want simple answers to complex questions they do not understand   she finds the only market
for her brand of incompetent yammering 

Facts don’t matter Evidence doesn’t matter History doesn’t matter Just look at the clips
Bill Maher runs of her blithering insistent certainty She pisses off EVERYONE all the time 
and never once   not a single time ever   stops long enough to even CONSIDER that maybe shes
the one who doesn’t get it Its THEY who don’t get it The constitutional lawyers dont
know fuck all about the constitution She does because she took a week long course at Oxford
University That she lies about her academic credentials inflates beyond all reason and truth
the actual degree of study she has accomplished does not in any way diminish her insistence
that she IS highly educated   really VERY knowledgeable about all of these things she doesnt
know about 

Richard Dawkins doesn’t know anything about the  Theory  of evolution he’s just a cranky
atheist She read a pamphlet from the Discovery Institute that totally explains the difference
between Creationism and Intelligent Design which are not the same things not at all and
anyone who says they are is just wrong Especially that court in Dover that found as a matter
of FACT that the ID crowd simply used  Find Replace  to substitute  Intelligent Design 
for  Creation  resulting in numerous instances of  Intelligent Designism  But fuck it 
Everyone is wrong Christine  O’Donnell is right And if you disagree with her then you are
properly an object of scorn and derision for being so poorly informed about things 

It may not be campaigning to WIN She may well know that she’s unelectable But in her mind
thats because the voters have been brainwashed by the same evil wrong headed liberal  
progressive indoctrination that has corrupted our schools our leaders and our society 

Christine  O’Donnell doesn’t have a hidden agenda She sees herself as morally correct 
profoundly right in both senses of the term and struggling as only a jebus loving martyr
can against the tide of evil sweeping her nation 

As for why she consistently gets to appear on television she’s fuckable in that weird
Sarah Palin way that makes me recoil in horror and wonder what the fuck is wrong with anyone
who would touch those women with their worst enemys cock Shell say apeshit nuts
things about masturbation and flirting with witchcraft and insist that these things that SHE
knows   things no one else knows like the top secret information about Chinas plans to take
over the USA to which only SHE is privy places her in the unique position to lecture Obama
on Con Law Henry Kissinger on foreign policy history Richard Dawkins on evolution Lawrence
Krause on cosmology and Murray Gell Mann on particle physics She KNOWS things see  Jebus
tells her things 

Frankly I think its the result of the move in the s and s to tell students that they
were ALL special that no one was any better or any smarter than anyone else that everyone
has a RIGHT to their own opinion to make sure that everyone who played the game got a
trophy Now those self inflated self important self esteem fiddled crowd are running
for office and they are fucking well convinced that they DO know as much as anyone else and
their OPINIONS about things are just as valid as anyone elses even moreso because  its MY
opinion and who are YOU to tell me that I don’t know what i’m talking about  YOU don’t know
what you’re talking about  

Knowing she’s going to lose is not the same thing as running TO lose in the same way that
knowing she really doesn’t know much about the constitution will never prevent her from
telling you what it must mean She thinks she’s right today and she will think she’s
right after being stomped to death at the polls She will continue to blither her vacuous
bullshit on any platform she can find spend campaign money on her rent and go to bed every
night feeling as though she is fighting the good fight for jebus truth and America

Lex   Thanks for the clarification It looks like you might have an inside track into this
persons make up But i’m still going to think that her smile wasn’t so much that she’s in on
the joke as it was she really does think she knows what she’s talking about It is a
debate after all a competition To just shrug your shoulders and throw a hail mary pass with
a smile on your face would be suicidal But really who the hell knows

Eminent Domain Used To Usurp Wine Label Real Estate


 I was disappointed though not surprised to see that today a conjunctive
labeling law dictating that  Sonoma County  be placed on every label on wines
produced from grapes grown in Sonoma County was unanimously passed by the California Legislature Pushed as an
effort to promote  Sonoma County  wines and a consumer education effort the new
law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines
their own marketing efforts Yet the law does nothing to educate consumers 
Passed unanimously out of the California Assembly and Senate AB now awaits
the Governors signature which it will surely obtain According to Noreen
Evans an Assembly sponsor of the bill this new conjunctive labeling law
 requires that any wine labeled with an American Area AVA located
entirely within Sonoma County     like Russian River Valley or Dry Creek Valley
  must also include the word  Sonoma County  on the label starting in 
There are AVAs in Sonoma County  
The problem of course is that by placing the words  Sonoma
County  on a bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in  Russian River
Valley   Dry Creek Valley   Sonoma Valley  or any other AVA in
County  have any single distinguishing feature derived from the
fact that they were grown inside the borders of Sonoma County County 
consumers learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle There no
evidence that grapes grown in  
Assemblywoman Evans concludes  By improving consumer education on each bottle 
conjunctive labeling will unleash the full potential of our delicious wines to
represent Sonoma around the world  
Shes correct Beginning in  Sonoma County  will receive a tremendous boost
in recognition due to the conjunctive labeling law that forces vintners to add
more wording to their labels whether they think the words  Sonoma County  help
or hurt their marketing efforts 
Frankly if I was making high end wine from the  Sonoma Valley   Sonoma
Mountain  or  Sonoma Coast  AVAs that depended in part on the quality
recognition that comes wtih these AVAs Id be pissed that i’m forced now to put
a place name on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the
wine behind my label and in some cases demonstrably lowered its perceived
quality 
Honore Comfort Executive Director of the Sonoma County Vintners Association and
an outstanding representative for Sonoma County wines noted this    This
moment marks the beginning of a stronger Sonoma County brand for generations
to come  
Proponents of the new Sonoma County Conjunctive labeling law like to point to a
similar law that demands  Napa Valley  be placed on all wines that are made from
grapes grown in that appellation rather than simply using a sub appellation 
They point to the prestige that the  Napa Valley  designation carries But this
prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands  Napa Valley  in addition
to simply  Rutherford  be placed on these wines It has to do entirely with the
promotional effort that has gone into making  Napa Valley  a place associated
with great wines 
Such an association will not be made with  Sonoma County 
wines ever The vintners in Sonoma County simply cant make a case for
 Sonoma County  having any meaning or for a region as vast as  Sonoma
County  delivering any degree of quality to the grapes 
Why is it important for someone making  Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir  or  Sonoma
Valley Zinfandel  to help promote  Sonoma County  a designation that has no
ability to define the quality or character of the wines in my Sonoma Coast Pinot
Noir or my Sonoma Valley Zinfandel 
This is an example of a County usurping the private label real estate and its
very valuable real estate for the sake of promoting something that is of little
use to private commercial interests Ask yourself If putting the words  Sonoma
County  on ones wines was such a great thing why don’t more vintners who make
 Dry Creek Valley   Russian River Valley   Alexander Valley  or  Sonoma
Valley  wines already put these words on their label  They legally could if
they wanted to 

The new Sonoma County conjunctive labeling law is the equivalent
of the State of California and the County of Sonoma claiming imminent domain
over the labels of hundreds of vintners 




Comments

 Nick Perdiew said I love it Tom You found a way to tie this in nicely 
This is a case of over reaching government regulation costing business
unnecessarily and burdening them with more regulations Its just
unnecessary 
 It also is a social promotion in the sense that great Sonoma wines that
now are forced to use  Sonoma County  will be giving some of their
credibility to their lesser neighbors Shades of wealth redistribution as
well   Ew ew ew

James McCann said How many hundreds or thousands of labels will have to be
re submitted to the TTB between now and   
 August at AM 


John Kelly said   Id be pissed that i’m forced now to put a place name
on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the wine behind
my label and in some cases demonstrably lowered its perceived quality   
 Exactly Tom And I am really pissed And so is every other producer I have
discussed this issue with I still don’t know whose interests are being
served by this useless piece of crap legislation I completely agree with
you when you state  Such an association will not be made with Sonoma
County wines ever   Duh 
 i’ve got real skin in this game We are going to have to totally redesign
our front label to make room for  Sonoma County    and so far every mock up
is cluttered and decreases the impact of our brand 
 Our best option looks like we will go to  North Coast  or  California  for
our front label appellation and discuss the grape source vineyard name and
meaningful AVA on the back label 
 Who is going to compensate me for this  I estimate the value to be in six
figures and we are a small winery For a larger winery with a
better established brand the value is much higher 
 Eminent domain is exactly right   this is nothing less than governmental
 taking   The legislators who backed this should be ashamed They should
also expect to lose my vote for them next election

Hardy Wallace said Thanks Tom   This law is such BS

JohnLopresti said I put in   decades in trade coursework and several
branches of the industry I support the new labeling requirement 
 Sonoma county always was the sheep ranch joke in the era of Napas
well deserved early global fame Sonoma county now is as good or better
than those early Napa vintages Together we have led the world into modern
viticulture with the help of UC Davis and in some pretty good company from
other regions 
 I suppose the new law is all Sacramento hype But I think it will improve
North coast revenue and dignity I admit I have voted for the bills
authoress 
 When I was a kid in a county called Solano not too famous for wines or
AVAs people sometimes would happen by our place asking where rte was 
where was Black Pt people always were confused how the somewhat
neighboring counties had such similar names Now after several decades in
Sonoma county I have learned to appreciate its uniqueness for its
viticulture and other industries 
 The town of Sonoma is on a typical route people follow driving from Solano
County to Sonoma County The ambience in the town Sonoma is only an enclave 
it is rightfully proud of its heritage as a village and for its
viticultural traditions But Sonoma county encompasses much more territory 
and other AVAs within the county are starkly different from the
characteristics of Sonoma valley and the town of Sonoma 
 Aint many people still overseeing vineyard blends Vive la nouveau Sonoma

Nick Perdiew said in 
 to John Lopresti John Good of you to comment and good to have dissent 
What do you make of the fact that vintners already are free to put Sonoma
County on any label they want  Govt cannot mandate marketing effectiveness
anymore than it can mandate perception of quality If it were effective 
would’nt you already see it virtually everywhere  I admit I don’t see the
reasoning of your argument here The issue of the costs to vintners is
non trivial too as you can see above 
 August at PM 


Bill Cadman said Tom   I wonder what the response would be in Napa and
Sonoma if the vintners in Fresno convinced the state government to require
 California  be put on all labels of wine made within California  
 August at AM 


John Lopresti said These past few years eminent domain has become a
libertarian property rights flashpoint since the  New London CT 
case concerning urban renewal polemics I can see Tom concerns too 
 There was a counterpoint in the label world after some court cases resulted
in a company’s revising its grape sourcing to comply with tightened
requirements for in county fruit in order to remain legal in designating
the wine as from  Napa  One rambling articles author counted 
occurrences of the word Napa on the newly designed label of a famous budget
wine producers Napa cabernet sauvignon

terminology goes on wine labels  those concerns belong to the federal govt
and the TTB which already mandates in fairly exhaustive detail what goes

JohnLopresti said vive la OIVV OIV Wine Labelling Standard EN  
 re at Fredric Ks BTYH website there is a review discussing MacRostie pinot
noir I had thought of the kiltman with respect to a new AVA in Yorkville
highlands thinking the Scot might have interest in playing the bagpipes in
the uplands Then at Steves site there is an interesting discussion of his
current ongoing efforts with blends from Carneros and Sonoma Coast Its
easy to get lost in nomenclatures when one is striving for new concepts 
 In a way all this tries to approach terroir from a slight distance plus
the historical distinctions between the two premium distinctive varietal
regions Napa county and Sonoma county Winkler heat summation datapoints
also clarified several decades ago some of the plant physiologic
underpinnings of why Napa county and Sonoma county were the natural leaders
in premium winegrape production There are many reasons why the new labeling
requirement makes sense from all these perspectives

El Jefe said OK so here’s the real requirement 
  Any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area established yada yada 
that is located entirely within yada yada shall bear the designation
 Sonoma County  on the label in a type size not smaller than two millimeters
on containers of more than milliliters or smaller than one millimeter on
containers of milliliters or less   
 If I recall correctly this is almost exactly the same as the requirement
for the government warning type size 
 So the answer seems pretty clear to me just add  Sonoma County  to the
government warning 
 September at PM 


Johnonwine said  They Honore Comfort and the Sonoma County Vintners 
point to the prestige that the  Napa Valley  designation carries But this
prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands  Napa Valley  in
addition to simply  Rutherford  be placed on these wines It has to do
entirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making  Napa Valley 
a place associated with great wines 
 Such an association will not be made with  Sonoma County  wines ever 
 Tom I would suggest that all Napa wineries good and bad benefit from
having Napa Valley on the label it is indeed a great example of marketing  
what you describe as promotional effort 
 Perhaps the proponents of the law are not doing the job they were hired to
do perhaps the SCV needs a more passionate communicator on their marketing
team putting together the quality promotion you suggest is impossible 
 Sonoma County with roughly half of the wineries of Napa County wins
roughly twice as many gold medals in national and international wine
competitions That the fact that their wines cost less on average and the
wineries are friendlier less snooty is a compelling story to get out to the
public 
 Heck if folks knew all that maybe folks would be seeking out bottles with
 Sonoma County  on the label 
 You suggest that this is a bad law that Sonoma County will never be
associated with high quality wine in the way Napa County is I disagree but
I am eternally hopeful optimistic that the Sonoma County Vintners will
inject a little passion and not more of the same old staid and boring in
their marketing communications I have confidence they will change retool 
improve live up to their responsibilities 
 I worked selling and marketing Sonoma County wines I won awards for my
marketing efforts The story is simple People are receptive to it Selling
the magic of Sonoma County wines is easy 
 that’s my take anyway I don’t aim to be contrarian but I don’t mind being
the sole supporter of the law   as a Sonoma County born and bred wine guy

H R The Lies The Facts The Fictions


With so much at stake for Americas alcohol wholesalers and their protected
monopoly status that props up unearned profits its no surprise they would
swing for the fences with all their state granted political power and
attempt to pass H R 
 This bill currently in Congress would give wholesaler
lobbyists the means to turn back the clock on consumer access to wine lead
to the passage of laws that override federal regulations on alcohol kill
jobs and business that focus on artisan production of wine beer and
spirits punish and dismantle small specialty wine retailers that serve the
consumers that wholesalers wont and override the critical Constitutional
principle of a single American economic union all for the sake of
protecting wholesaler profits by giving them unprecedented control and
influence over the entire American alcohol industry 
But what is truly remarkable and likely a result of the wholesalers hubris
stemming from years of being granted government welfare is their
willingness to misrepresent facts ignore the truth and mislead in their
defense of H R 
The recently launched www hr org
website is the creation of the National Beer Wholesalers Association and and
appears to be the repository all the misrepresentation ignorance and
misleading ideas supporters of H R could possibly muster 
For the sake of context and setting the record straight this post address
many of the misrepresentations and misleading claims made at the middlemens
disingenuous new website 
On their homepage http   www hr org  

 Todays system balances competition with public safety to
ensure that consumers can enjoy alcohol without suffering the negative
effects of an unregulated marketplace 


Is there really any competition when the state based
regulatory system the wholesalers love so much require that producers of
alcohol use a wholesaler to bring their goods to market meaning that
without use of a wholesaler a producer cannot enter a states market  It
also means that wholesalers get to decide what consumers drink not
consumers 


 Unfortunately the effective state based regulatory system in
the U S is under attack Over the past years more than states
have faced challenges in federal courts to their authority to regulate
alcohol and their ability to maintain a licensed system of alcohol
controls  
The only challenges to the state based alcohol regulatory
system are those that discriminate against interstate commerce for
protectionist reasons Even in the wake of successful suits that
challenged the protectionist laws that wholesalers originally pushed 
the state retained extraordinarily broad authority to maintain a robust
system of alcohol controls 

ON THE  LEARN MORE  PAGE http   www hr org learn more  Litigation
against the states brought by those wishing to deregulate alcohol for
their own economic interests is of great concern to state alcohol
regulators state attorneys general public health advocates and many
others  When the economic interests of producers 
retailers and consumers are horsewhipped by states doing the bidding of
wholesales who receive more government protection and welfare from the
state than any other industry in america you might expect them to fight
back As for those that have  concern  let’s recall that its only a
tiny fraction of state alcohol regulators that there is no formal
support from state attorneys general only a mere handful of public
health advocates a selection of recipients of campaign contributions
from wholesalers and wholesalers themselves that support H R 
 

 According to a recent national poll conducted by the Center
for Alcohol Policy of respondents support the right of individual
states to set their own laws and regulations surrounding the sale of
alcohol and agree that state and local laws regarding alcohol
regulations should be decided by lawmakers and citizens not by
judges  
Im shocked shocked i say that the  center for alcohol
policy  is an arm of the national beer wholesalers association and that
it would conduct a poll that finds results supporting those that funded
the poll Does it get any more illegitimate 

On the  Fact v Fiction page http   www hr org fact vs fiction  FACT This
bill does not address direct shipping or any specific state alcohol law 
It does not preempt a state law that allows direct shipping It does not
mandate a direct shipping law where there currently is not one The bill
does PROTECT a states wine shipping law if someone were to challenge it
in court by providing the shipping law with the same presumption of
validity granted other state alcohol laws  Disingenuous in the extreme And whats worse the wholesalers knew
this when they wrote this H R gives states the ability to pass
laws unchallengeable in court that would discriminate against
out of state wine shippers And we know such laws would be introduced
into various states since wholesalers have seen to it that such laws
have been introduced into state legislatures for the past years In
fact H R would allow states to pass laws that make consumers
receipt of a wine by in state shippers legal while making receipt of a
wine by out of state shippers punishable to a greater degree than rape 
home invasion or selling cocaine to children  Fact 
Protection of a states power to regulate alcohol is not an  industry
food fight food fight  may be the wrong word 
Better to call the introduction of H R what it is an attack on
the entire alcohol industry and consumers for the sake of protecting
wholesaler profits Its no coincidence that brewers large and small 
wineries spirit producers and importers retailers wine education
organizations wine consumers and free trade organizations all oppose
H R 


 This bill does not amend or alter the Federal Alcohol
Administration Act FAA Act which provides federal guidelines in many
of these areas 
No it doesn’t  amend  the faa act It overrides it entirely 
To quote from H R 
 not withstanding that the state or territorial law
may burden interstate commerce or an act of congress the state law
shall be upheld  
This claim by the wholesalers that H R  does not
amend  federal regulations on alcohol is a straight up
misrepresentation Its like saying  i didn’t kick the dog but rather
his ribs fell on to my boot  


 It is the intent of this language to make clear the
congressional support for the holding in Granholm prohibiting state laws
that allow an in state winery to do something a similarly situated
out of state winery cannot do Language that bars facial discrimination
is included in the bill to codify this prohibition 
I have great faith in the wholesalers ability to mislead 
But this goes beyond even my expectation The intent of H R is
precisely to overturn the granholm v Heald supreme court decision that
did away with protectionist state alcohol laws More importantly the
very language of H R gives states the explicit right to
discriminate against out of state wine shippers All the state needs to
do is offer the feeblest of justifications Read for yourself  state or
territorial regulations may not facially discriminate without
justification against out of state producers of alcoholic beverages in
favor of in state producers   one of those  justifications  the bill
states is maintenance of the  structure of the state alcoholic beverage
distribution system   in other words discrimination is ok as long as
the discrimination is written into the states alcohol beverage
distribution laws Furthermore note that wine retailers are not even
covered by this duplicitous language on  justification  The state needs
no justification to discriminate against out of state retailers 


 Over half the states have been sued challenging their
alcohol laws The lawsuits have attacked items such as commonsense
safeguards that require a face to face transaction needed for I D 
checks to buy alcohol 
In fact face to face transactions are not needed for I D
checks We know this because states have written laws that have gone
unchallenged that require I D Checks to be made at the point of
delivery of the wine 


 Unelected judges should not set alcohol policy this
responsibility rightly rests with individual state legislatures as
guaranteed under the st Amendment to the U S Constitution  
Judges never have set policy State legislatures always
have This is the big lie the wholesalers tell Judges merely tell the
state when they have reached beyond what the st Amendment allows 
After that the state legislatures in every state where litigation has
affected badly crafted laws went about legislating a fix Surely the
wholesalers don’t mean to say that state alcohol laws should in no way
be required to abide by the principles in the u S Constitution What
next will the wholesalers argue the st amendment give the states the
right to prohibit women from buying alcohol  Will they argue that state
laws banning African Americans from being distributors is legal under
the st Amendment 


 State laws that raise concerns can and should be addressed
in the state legislature  
Lucky for Americans it wasn’t this attitude that ruled the
day when jim crow laws were in place The wholesalers would have argued
that the racist  separate but equal  philosophy had no business being
litigated and that we should wait for the legislatures that enacted the
racist laws to overturn them with new laws We have courts precisely to
adjudicate concerns with the fairness and constitutionality of state
laws But of course wholesalers know this They to have brought states
to court over alcohol distribution laws they didn’t think were fair or
constitutional It appears that wholesalers don’t like the courts
involved when the decision don’t go their way 

The hypocrisy misleading notions and disinformation being featured at the
wholesalers website supporting H R is staggering However they do the
right thing when they invite readers to sign up for emails that will deliver
 the latest developments  I urge all readers to sign up for those emails 
In the mean time please checkout the website that spurred the wholesalers to
launch their own http   www stophr org It is published by the
Specialty Wine Retailers Association and upon reading through it you should
find yourself feeling much cleaner and less soiled than after wading through
the misrepresentations of the new wholesaler sponsored website on H R

r said Wow I am speechless I will not even waste my
time rebutting you point by point because you do not have a clue in many
instances what you are talking about You do have a few valid points but
they too may be predicated on false premise I do not claim to be the
all knowing expert By using the same sensational BS Tactics you rail
against instead of a balanced and fair assessment you render the
entirety of your rant incredible In short the wine has to go from point
A to B in some way Do you work for FedEx  It sounds like you would
prefer you government welfare to go there instead  Wholesalers compete
against each other perhaps you forgot They do not operate
monopolies In Oregon for instance there are about wholesalers
competing for partnerships on both the supply and the demand side 
hardly the ideal monopoly situation In most cases where state laws
allow shipping you can get a bottle of wine shipped from the winery of
your choice A very important point to remember While large  commercial
wineries  Factory wine producers may have the ability to market their
own wine smaller growers whom you seem to be so concerned about do not
have the proper infrastructure to allow wine sales on line in many
cases let alone having their own transportation infrastructure They
are experts at farming and producing wine which is what they likely
prefer to do in most cases July at PM

Facebook Fans You Get What You Pay For
 Mar 
by Rick

Take a look at the Facebook Fan Pages of some brands and what you see is not a
pretty picture Oh the numbers look good but when you dig a little deeper a
different picture emerges Walls filled with off topic conversations at best 
vile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst What happened  Wasnt
having thousands of fans supposed to be a good thing 
Well yes and no Sure its great having several hundred thousands fans But how
did you come to get those fans  Did you earn them through fantastic customer
service fulfilling the brand promise providing value to the community in an
authentic and passionate voice or did you run a Facebook ad campaign and hit
the broadcast airwaves with a promotion 
Lets look at my old favorite TGI Fridays 
 If you can see this then you might need a Flash Player upgrade or you need to
install Flash Player if its missing Get Flash Player
from Adobe 
Remember that ad  Pretty cool right  In fact as I recall they got over 
million Facebook fans Google TGI Fridays Fan Woody and it looks pretty good 
But then something not so awesome happened All those fans wanted their free
burgers and they wanted them now TGI Fridays completely lost control of the
page and eventually doled out a lot of free burgers Now from a short term
perspective i’m sure they did ok on the deal People came in and ate their food 
But they could have accomplished that with coupons in the mail the newspaper or
by an email list But they decided to go the Social Media route 
Now let’s take a look at what the Fridays FanWoody Facebook page looks like
today 
Whoops Its gone 
Apparently Woody and his
   fans went poof How come  i’m guessing it had something to do
with the venom and general anarchy the page had created by buying fans rather
than growing them A TGI
Fridays Facebook page does exist with roughly a third of the fans they
used to have TGI Fridays pretty much had to spray Agent Orange on
their relationship with people 
Its easy to pick on TGI Fridays but they certainly arent the only guilty
party I think plenty of brands have heard the siren call of Facebook ads The
ability to target your demo is really terrific but you’re in danger of creating
a relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a  what have you done for
me lately  foundation 
First you essentially bought these fans You paid Facebook for the right to
target them Then in the case of TGI Fridays or other brands that offer free
product or discount coupons you are essentially buying them again This sets up
a pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with
a tangible item that is free stuff that’s not a bonus item its now a
standard part of the agreement Want me as a fan  Give me free stuff 
The point of Social Media isn’t to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to
engage with a brand for a whole host of reasons often free   discounted product
is the least of these reasons i’m not saying that special bonuses or surprise
and delight offers arent ever a good thing I think when used properly they
can be terrific What do I mean by used properly  As a reward for people who
have engaged with the brand in a meaningful way Send us a picture of you
wearing a brand t shirt and sure youve earned a free sandwich Recruit some
friends and i’m happy to give you all some coupons But when fans enter the
relationship feeling they are entitled to free samples and you’re in
trouble 




 Kathy Sharpe says April at pm

About time there was some acknowledgement of the true value of fans Even if
you have million  fans and they are all well behaved citizens what is the
real marketing value 











How soon is now  Lebron James Makes His Decision The A Rod
Route
 Jul 
by Rick

Lebron James is an extremely talented basketball player he’s also a very astute
individual who understands how to use the media    and various communication
channels    to his advantage he’s also managed to surround himself with people
who understand business but i’m starting to wonder if he’s lost a bit of
understanding of American culture 
Lebron didn’t play college basketball he went straight from high school to the
pros and since joining the Cleveland Cavaliers he’s won exactly zero NBA
champions he’s a free agent now and tonight he made his decision about which
team he’s going to play for in a very public manner with a live announcement on
ESPN 
Earlier this week Lebron jumped on Twitter and quickly gained a massive
following This morning he announced 

Lebron James was of course a trending topic and that hashtag was burning as
well 
But i’m starting to wonder if Lebron isn’t painting himself into a corner and
has maybe misread how quickly sentiment can change 
Sure Shaquille ONeal once said  Ive won
at every level but college and pro   but Shaq was always a larger than
life literally character who was outgoing and had a great relationship with
fans that’s one of the reasons 
Shaqs been a huge hit on Twitter Lebron doesn’t have that sort of
relationship with fans I think an appropriate comparison might be Alex
Rodriguez An incredibly talented player    perhaps the best in the game    who
went a very long time without winning a ring 
By making his announcement in this public way Lebron has only heaped more
pressure on himself Ask A Rod how the media can turn on you when you put
yourself above your teammates above the game James now finds himself in the
following position 
 Winning a title is expected immediately wherever he goes
 Not winning a title will be seen as a massive disappointment
 Winning a title will result in some saying that he couldnt do it alone
 he’s put himself in a position where if he leaves Cleveland every other city
 and Cleveland will be rooting against him
Sounds just like Alex Rodriguez doesn’t it  i’m no longer the target demographic
for most of the products Lebron endorses but you know what matters to me 
Winning championships Not live prime time press conferences not
self aggrandizing twitter hashtags and not quitting on his teammates during the
playoffs 
Lets see what the future holds for Lebron We know hell be rich but how will
he be viewed by fans across the country Perhaps Lebron should have hired a 
Chief Culture Officer along with his coterie of other advisors If I
were to fulfill that role for him I would have told him to go low key with this
decision and let it be led by his new team Make sure its clear that the team
comes first and that he’s looking forward to being part of the team That the
only thing that matters is winning a championship 
That that was the main factor 
Update 
Lebron chooses the Miami Heat and the similarities to A Rod continue 
with Dwyane Wade playing the role of Derek Jeter 
Update And so it begins

The effect of not being on vacation in Italy on a man with a tall stack of
papers to grade 

As you probably noticed my wife is currently on vacation without me    which is different
than a vacation from me although given how frequently insufferable I am 
I could understand the appeal of such in the le Marche region of Italy which is immediately
south of Tuscany and full of communists As evidence of how thoroughly corrupt the region is I
present a picture courtesy of her of the cabin shell be staying in free of
charge until July 
 that’s the view shell be writing her dissertation to the next two months The region is poor
 though not so much as I thought and
poorly serviced by internet and wifi theres a router up the hill from her which sometimes
provides wifi but only then into a loft too unbearably hot to occupy during the day So the
only opportunity I have to talk to her via Skype is that last hour in the late evening when
the loft cools enough to be habitable provided of course that the wifi strength that evening
is strong enough to establish and maintain a connection Which it frequently isn’t But this
post isn’t about how melancholy I become when I havent heard from her by p m which would be
midnight over there because anyone who follows me on Facebook already knows that and because this post concerns Urbino not my daily descent into emo 
Ive written about Urbino before but because the wife is providing me with such dazzling photographs
of the city I feel compelled to do so again As I noted in that post Urbino is not a
 built  city so much as an  evolved  one The De Landa seems to
have become an unwitting
theme of late Of course it was built but it was built vertically
within the city walls meaning that new buildings were constructed atop
existing ones like so 
 The effect is the sort of architecture one only finds in dreams or representations of them 
like the one in the finale of the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire
Slayer wherein Joss Whedon took advantage of contiguous three walled film sets to depict
Xander Harris moving seamlessly from the upstairs bathroom at Buffys house 

Into the Initiatives underground bunker 
Then from the bathroom Initiative across the hall 
Into his parents basement 
And into an ice cream truck 
Past the the come hither lesbians 
Through the back of the ice cream truck 
By means of a passage 
That returns him to you guessed it his parents basement 
In which he exits the same door he originally entered it from Buffys house only to end up in
the halls of Sunnydale High and shortly an Apocalypse Now parody 
 The only difference between what Whedon did and Urbino is that you could travel through the
side streets of Urbino with a camera and accomplish such feats minus the Coppola without needing to cut once Because without leaving officially sanctioned
lanes of transportation pedestrians can venture into and through outdoor kitchens university
departments the central hallway of apartment buildings and so on This photograph of the
dueling signs for the Hotel Raffaello the wife snapped the other day typifies the way the city
feels 
 You can enter the hotel either through the door with the green awning or the second story
window of an adjacent building This isn’t technically true but it accurately describes how it
feels to those unaccustomed to the citys geography The city is even
more disturbing though because of the tendency of its sidewalks to transform into recessed
brick ladders when the street becomes too steep for bipeds
 That picture is not from the current set as the relative quality attests and if I remember
correctly by which I mean  recognize the fingerprints of amateur photographers the world
over who think a good photograph is one framed in the most dull and predictable way
possible  snapped by me I only mention that because in I visited the city with the
wife and as you probably guessed the real point of this post was to indulge in a bit of
vicarious vacationing before returning to a stack of ungraded papers that no amount of actual
grading seems to have the power to reduce 
 If it wasn’t even Homer nods  No but seriously if that’s not a picture I actually took 
its exactly the sort I relentlessly take whereas check out the wifes chops above the woman has
an eye 



If she is working she is not on vacation AND this time apart will make you stronger and
make you realize marriage is work and you need to put some in or the marriage dies and you are
left with an empty hole in your heart I know this is over kill but you need to get out of
the funk you are in and grade the papers and finish the course so you can get some down time
and catch up on your sleep

United carbon offset disappointment
April AM


Im a big believer in carbon offsets not so much the cap and trade game but in
the simple internalize your externality sort I talk about it in my Green
Culture talk IMHO we all have an ethical obligation to offset our carbon
footprint    now My wife and I have been doing so for a couple years Were a
couple months late buying credits for last year 

One reason were late other than the obvious is the insane complexity in
calculating it well I travel way too much that’s the biggest chunk to cover 
But to calculate it accurately requires churning through a pile of flights I
could estimate no doubt But I want something more accurate 

So I was really happy to see on the United page an announcement of a  Carbon
Offset Program   What I expected it to be was a simple way to at least know what
the total carbon footprint from your flights for some period was after all 
they have all the data and ideally a simple way to buy offsets 

No such luck United has simple linked to one of the million places where you can
calculate a per flight carbon cost It
allows you to input total miles flown but its Mileage Plus page doesn’t give you
total miles flown it gives you the
total added to your account included bonuses etc 

Looking forward to version

Peter Collopy Dopplr has a nice carbon calculator built in You have to
enter all your trips but I think its generally an exciting system if you
dont mind the Little Brother surveillance 


April AM lessig GREAT point I do enter all mine in Perfect
solution 


April AM
Padraic Why arent you a supporter of cap trade  isn’t a mandatory
scheme going to moresuccesful than voluntary measures 


April AM lessig I favor a mandatory scheme    internalize
your externality I am suspicious of cap trade It seems like a
complicated partial version of that created by the same genius quants who
gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate large fees
finance types My sense is for a simpler system 


April PM Padraic Ryan Re cap trade   you shouldnt use
the financial crisis as an excuse to write off all of economics A cap 
trade system worked very well at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution in the
US finance types and all you’re right that a carbon tax is definitely
simpler but there are upsides to cap trade as well such as the fact
that the market will drive the price up whereas a tax wont increase unless
Congress wants it to 

Re your green culture talk I think you are misappropriating the Gore clip 
isnt he saying that your money would be better spent on political
candidates and organizations that push for mandatory internalizing of
externalities changing the laws instead of on carbon offsets changing the
lightbulbs   My problem with carbon offsets and other voluntary measures is
that given the finite amount of money energy and attention we have to push
for the environment I feel like the opportunity cost of these measures is
too high compared to policy oriented actions the citizen role that Gore
referred For example Earth Hour would be much more productive if it were a
global rally for carbon taxes instead we de politicize it and entertain the
idea that voluntarily turning off lights will stop climate change 

Im a big fan of your work on IP and corruption but i’m skeptical of these
initial ventures into the environmental arena 


April PM mark  I am suspicious of cap trade It seems
like a complicated partial version of that created by the same genius
quants who gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate

That just shows you do not fully understand the cap and trade model or the
global financial crisis 


April PMCathy When you book a route on United it tells you how
many miles it will accrue pre bonus for each leg I use it to calculate
how many Ill get towards my premier status Its a tiny link they move
around from time to time but look for it near where the seat selection
option is You should see this on a screen before you purchase the ticket 
and possibly also after 


April PM Brad Templeton When I got to Uniteds site it has two
columns one for true miles flown sort of and one for elite bonus So cut
and paste into your spreadsheet and it should be fine However it does show
 for the short haul flights but I bet those are mostly L A so you can
fill in the real mileage to L A on those it should not take long April
 PMYaacov Iland Id check into the effectiveness of carbon
offsets particularly tree plantations before spending money on them 
http   www newint org features       keynote 


April AM Jardinero The only way to reduce your carbon
footprint is to reduce your carbon footprint period Paying someone else
to do something they are doing already does not reduce your carbon
footprint one bit 

If you don’t believe that and still insist on paying someone else to consume
less then please consider paying me My wife and I telecommute We rarely
travel I ride my bike to the grocery store We cook from whole ingredients
and never eat processed or prepared foods Both of our cars are high mpg and
rarely used They are both ten years old and we probably wont replace them
for another ten years I just finished insulating my house and installed
high efficiency windows and HVAC I keep the thermostat high in the summer
and low in the winter All the light bulbs are fluorescent except for the
dimmer above the dining room table I removed all the turf from my property
and replaced it with vines and perennials There are twenty three trees on
the property sequestering CO on a continuous basis No motorized equipment
is required to maintain my garden which is now over ten thousand square feet
of CO consuming plants 

I would gladly accept the sum of fifteen thousand dollars from Prof Lessig or
anyone else to offset his carbon heavy lifestyle In return I would submit
to an audit of my lifestyle and I would issue him a certificate stating the
amount of his carbon offset 


April AM Eric the Red Carbon credits indulgences for the
non Catholic crowd More modern but just as dumb 


April AM pb  we all have an ethical obligation to offset our
carbon footprint    now

self righteousness but very little knowledge 

Carbon offsets harm environment
http   news bbc co uk   hi uk politics  stm Tuesday February
 GMT


Jutta Kill of the Forests and the European Union Resource Network FERN 
was the most vehement opponent of the practice arguing it probably did more
harm than good 

Carbon offsetting was  an unbelievably inefficient way of reducing
emissions   she argued and its effects were impossible to verify 

In addition  More than half  of the money given to companies selling carbon
offsets went on research and administration costs  benefiting not the
climate but the burgeoning consultancy industry  

 We believe it is worse than nothing because it creates the illusion or the
impression in the public that action is being taken while we are not
really addressing the task at hand significantly reducing greenhouse gas
emissions   Ms Kill told MPs 


Illusions are powerful around here it seems Professor   stop listening to
your  intuitions  and do some basic research 



May PM Jason Sperling Its nice to see feedback on the United
program i’ve posted your feedback on my carbon offsets news blog 

Currently many companies are reticent to putting something in their purchase
path as an upsell just as they are reticent to putting anything in their
purchase path The cost for large companies to make any updates to their
e commerce sites is significant another factor in keeping the type of
program youd like from being available Additionally there is a reluctance
to share the data required for accurate emissions measurement due to
perceived potential risks possibly related to future regulatory
concerns 

The technology is certainly available When the type of program you imagine
IS put in place the results have been very good For example ShopGreen
Merchant Reports of customers go green

This is the first in a series of articles by guest blogger The
Apocalyptic Housewife 



Somewhere in California a blighted mosquito vector abandoned property is
about to get an echinacea dose via seedbomb 

Seedbombing combines elements of childhood disgruntled mudbomb hurling the
balance of meticulousness and zen that good gardeners possess and my own
forte the invisibility and vigilance of a sniper 

It also requires a certain attitude The first step to seedbombing is 
Understand that a job worth doing is worth doing crappily 

You will fuck it up Live with this Embrace it 
Nothing worth
doing was learned perfectly the first time If Mother Nature herself were
perfect she would’nt  need us urban urchins to help cover her
scars with flowering seeds 

Heres where we started  


Gift seeds of California Poppy via Jessica Reeders mom Thanks 
MamaHun 


 Mix in seeds 

Use seeds of any kind even dumpster salvaged ones or the ones that might be too
old for the garden 

You can mix them with a     mix of potting soil worm casings and clay Or
you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at
that estate sale last year and get to mixing 


NOTE Cover your work area Dust can fly into your mouth and
eyes very easily If the fertilizer in the mix is what I think it is that
wouldnt be pretty Use gloves to break up the soil with your
fingers 


 Make bombs 

Form the mix into balls of any size from sling shot pellet up to softball 
Youre going to be throwing them Customize it yourself 

Mine were more or less matzoh ball size and shape out of habit This worked out
pretty well 

Allow to dry overnight or until theyre solid enough for the next
step 
 Throw 

Today I kept it simple I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from
downtown and two vacant lots The leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the
freeway offramps 


First lesson learned    you need at least two people to seedbomb from a
vehicle The first responsibility should be driving safely I found this
hard to do while also avoiding cops dealing with the camera and the car window 
scoping out angles of approach for throwing etc 

I ended up with a broken fingernail and dirt all over my lap Also a perfect
strike But youll have to take my word because a camera at that moment
would have been crazy 

Second Lesson    keep the seedbombs in a shallow covered container 
You want both tidiness and easy access Plus those things are crumbly I made
eight the last two were totally pulverized after being jostled in a paper bag
for half an hour 

And the last lesson    have fun Its play Seedbombing is a
hit or miss way for change to take root pun intended Its chlorophyll
graffiti No one I know is getting diggd or favrd yet for throwing color
and scent around the ghetto Do it to see how it feels You may want to keep
checking on your flowers I promise I will or you might get an idea to do
something else completely unexpected I did 

Enzo Angolini spike heels found by serendipity at St Pauls Thrift for
 Sexy non 


For example make smaller wildflower seedbombs and carefully plant them
in a meridian by making holes in the ground with your heel and then gently tamping
the dirt over them with your sole 

This is also good practice for looking lost and cluelessly invisible More on that in
future posts 

 Enjoy 


Earth is my friend like that old classmate who you keep forgetting to drop a note to
on Facebook 


When I took a victory lap and hand wash break in the mall I was happy not in a
smug superior way but in the knowledge that I had avenged myself against the
whole Sunday at the mall culture that I felt smothered by I did it by throwing
flowers all along those places no one goes but where our planets future
lives 

There is one over riding message to this    Quit being such a goddamned
perfectionist Yes yes I know you know of much better places
to never throw those seedbombs you havent made You could get better soil
if you put it on the shopping list You undoubtedly write much better and could
have a real serious article with awesome non blurry pictures taken by a person
who actually can get the timer to work for a goddamn change The actions that
you never do are absolutely perfectly effective in your imagination 
But my actions accomplished something today 

Which brings us back to A job worth doing is worth doing crappily 

This blog is the digital proof

Tayaris Blog Theres A Sucker Born Every Minute

Posted by Tayari Jones on March PM 



And apparently they all go to work in publishing 

This has been a bad week for liars First the holocaust survivor who said she was literally
raised by wolves turns out to be just a regular if depressed person Now Margaret
Seltzer the author of Love and
Consequences the highly acclaimed  memoir  about her life as a half Native American half
White gang banger has been been explosed as a fraud 

In the vividly told book Ms Seltzer wrote about her African American foster brothers 
Terrell and Taye who joined the Bloods gang when they were and She chronicled her
experiences making drug deliveries for gang leaders at age and how she was given her first
gun as a birthday present when she was Ms Seltzer told The Times last week One of the
first things I did once I started making drug money was to buy a burial plot 

Its like a satire of a satire This is my favorite line in the whole NYT article  Sarah
McGrath the editor at Riverhead who worked with Ms Seltzer for three years on the book said
she was stunned to discover that the author had lied   Gotta love that understatement and comic
timing 

But seriously you may remember an article last summer that appered in TimeOut New York
about matters of race in publishing My post on the subject here This
was one of most important quotes from the article Invariably  says Craig  a
black themed book will come up for consideration and there wont be anyone of color to put in
an opinion or therell be one who shouldnt bear the burden alone So we all pretend were
experts Maybe i’m the only one whos embarrassed by that The end result of such
roundtables one can only fear could be that the only books depicting people of color that
get published are those that do not challenge white assumptions 


I cant help but wonder if Ms Seltzers book with all its far fetched 
tales from the urban jungle flair would have passed the smell test were it read by a more
diverse panel of editors

Noshin at the Tupelo Honey Cafe   Plus how to get great service in
busy restaurants

 Mar 





By the time I got to Asheville I was nearing the end of my journey and the
bottom of my wallet The last thing on my mind was spending money it was
beautiful outside and there were free things to do everywhere 

But When Id posted on Facebook that I was coming to town no fewer than three people told me
I just had to visit the Tupelo Honey Cafe So I checked their website and instantly fell in
love 


 Tupelo Honey Café opened in downtown Asheville in an early pioneer in
the farm to fork movement and an active advocate for the independent
restaurant landscape that pervades the city Our food is fresh made from
scratch sassy and scrumptious Our cuisine salutes our love of Southern
traditions at the table but like the good people of Asheville marches to
its own drum The result is a unique riff on Southern favorites   tupelohoneycafe com


I was convinced but I wasn’t alone On a sunny Sunday afternoon the waiting list
was an hour long After hemming and hawing and assessing my food stash
 contents saltines I decided to go for it anyway 

By the time I finally got a seat at the counter I was starved It took me about
thirty seconds to pick out the Charleston Chicken Sandwich  grilled
marinated free range chicken breast on sourdough with melted havarti romaine
lettuce and cranberry mayonnaise  Free range  Cranberry  Havarti  Yes I
could dig it 

While I waited for the food I checked out the back of the store where Tupelo
Honey Cafe hawks their homestyle wares preserves pickles salsa honey 
t shirts aprons and all sorts of mini advertisements for the restaurant 

Ive visited plenty of farm to fork restaurants and this one may be the best
Ive seen at self marketing Theres nothing wrong with it the food in those
jars is probably delicious though I question whether the tupelo honey had
to come from Florida or if its produced locally 

Either way its nice to see a restaurant built on ethics that also happens to be
incredibly busy Some of that is surely due to good marketing but the real
reason for its popularity is this 

That sandwich was so good I found myself eating slower and slower with each bite
to savor it more completely The potatoes were light and un greasy the flavors
were perfectly balanced the chicken was juicy and rich and let’s be honest
here i’m always happier eating dead animals when I know theyve lived a good
life I found myself silently thanking the chicken for its delicious
contribution Thank you chicken I will never forget you 

I stopped eating halfway through not because I was full I stopped so I could
take the rest home and taste it again later 


On another topic I made a discovery there in the Tupelo Honey Cafe one which
Id like to share with you now 

If you’re going to a busy restaurant and want great service bring a camera Take
a few photos of the menu the kitchen the food 

No sooner had I taken the above photo when a server not even my server 
appeared at my elbow Later when I stopped eating and lifted my napkin from my
lap it took approximately three seconds for someone to take my food away to be
boxed up 

Now i’m not saying the service before my camera flash was bad because it was
awesome But wow it sure improved once I appeared to be some sort of food
critic or travel writer 

Which it just so happens I am But even if you’re not try this out sometime I
cant guarantee itll work but I personally will do it againand probably back
it up with a stellar review just like the one i’ve given the Tupelo Honey
Cafe 

Everybody wins 

Okay that’s it I could talk about Asheville for weeks but its time to move
on Next stop sunny Tennessee where I get down on The Farm 








Save the World Ride a Bike
a visit to Troy Bike Rescue

 Sep 

This post is the first of a three part series on bike culture Come back Friday to read about
anarchy 
bike jousting and two wheeled social protest 

Remember when you got your first bike  Was it a Christmas present or maybe a birthday gift 
Remember how much fun you used to have on that bike how fast you went how great it felt 
Well these days most kids want an Xbox for their birthday their parents ride around in
cars with seatbelts talking on their
phones Cycling is a thing of the past a sport a hobby but rarely a mode of
transportation But i’m here to tell you riding your bike is still fun and
still fast and its the cheapest and most socially responsible workout youll ever
get 
And there are no two ways about it if you give a kid a bike that kid will ride 
In Troy New York I met one Andrew Lynn he’s somewhat of a man
brain
trust and one of his best creations is the Troy Bike Rescue It started in when Andrew
would ride around town pulling bikes out of dumpsters He started hosting work parties with
friends in his backyard teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding 
Slowly but surely the circle grew and Andrews backyard parties became weekly workshops 
When Andrew decided to leave town for a few years schooling in NYC friends and cohorts took
over operations By the time Andrew returned Troy Bike Rescue let’s call it TBR had a life
of its own These days its an established club run by volunteers and donations turning
trashed bikes into treasures Its influence now includes a legitimate downtown storefront a
sister shop in Albany Albany Bicycle
Coalition movie screenings and pro cycling political events and a dedicated core crew
that keeps everything rolling 

TBRs customers run the gamut from businessmen to street kids to college students to
families The one thing they have in common  They get it 

This group understands the value of a bicycle more than just transportation a
bike is a statement against fossil fuels More than a toy its an equalizer that allows poor
kids to ride with rich More than a hobby its a way of traveling through the world that lets
you interact use your muscles breathe fresh air    all for the cost of a free dumpster
bike 


When I visited the TBR shop it was packed with frames wheels gears chains handlebars 
kids and anarchist art the space is being donated by some supporters who are also
anti capitalist activists 
TBR hosts workshops twice a week For a few hours the doors are open to anyone who walks in 
Tools are available and volunteers will help with advice and knowledge Parts can be had for a
pittance and you can pick out your own bike from the stacks and racks of machines filling the
space 

The main focus of TBR however is not selling bikes The idea is to give people a workspace
and teach them how to maintain their own bicycle Self sufficiency is a major tenet of the bike
movement and Troy Bike Rescue is training self reliant individuals of all stripes 
All around me college students and bike punks tinkered with their machines An older man
asked for tips on tuning his racer A young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he
needed a new one and despite Andrews stern reprimand that he couldnt just walk in every
week and leave with a free bike he did just that 

A dad came in with his three kids all of whom left with snazzy rides    but first they all
sat down and worked on their new wheels together 
And as we left at the end of the workshop a woman walked up to Andrew  I love what you do  
she said  I have a whole bunch of bikes to give you  
See ultimately TBR is about more than just bicycles Its about building community and
triggering a quiet but inexorable social movement This is not the worlds first bike
collective in fact its only one of many that have stealthily sprung up around America These
collectives are not waiting for change to happen theyre creating it through small positive 
peaceful actions You too can change the world all you have to do is ride a
bike 
Try This at Home Ride Around
Fall is here which in most places means great riding weather What are you waiting
for 
Bikes are cheap you can get one at your local thrift store for   It doesn’t have to be
perfect just good enough to get you places So pick one up and ride it to the end of your
block Then keep going 
Even if your life requires four wheels you can use a bike for local errands Ride it to the
corner store when you need milk instead of driving across town to the grocery store Dont
like the milk they sell  Tell the store owner what you like and see if hell carry it Now
youre changing the world 
On weekends instead of driving to the park hop on your bike and go exploring It doesnt
have to be a workout you can just toodle around town and look at stuff Or if you’re a gym
buff trade a workout for a bike ride Unless you live on a major highway odds are you can
ride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting 
On vacation rent a bike instead of a scooter or God forbid a Segway Its cheaper and
much better for the local flora fauna 
Still not convinced  Then think of it this way by riding your bike instead of driving your
car you’re reducing your consumption of fossil fuels You can even calculate the money you
save on gas and keep it in a jar for a rainy day 

Want to get involved  Bike clubs tend to be pretty anarchic but if you look around your
community youll find both bike riders and shop owners who ride for change Cant find a bike
community  Start your own

Tried shared re tweeted with pleasure My old thrift store basket handle witch  bike was
glad to see the light of day again Even kept Pansy in the basket as my Toto 
Bike rescue is not just for kids One of my dear friends who cant drive to due to combat
injuries had her ride stolen while we were sharing a beer in broad daylight last weekend 
Shame shame Her partner is a peace corps alum who also works in a bike shop I passed along
this article to her and she suggest that when we start our own bike rescue well do like the
U S in East Timor did and graffiti Delta Bike Rescue on all the chassis 
Fall is exactly more tingly when experienced by bike 









Farming on Sand The trouble with  eating local  on Cape Cod  
Uprooted an eco travel blog

This is part of a  part series on tourisms impact on Cape
Cod Read about death 
 carnage in the shell shop find out about the eco friendly 
food scene look at the pretty pretty sunset or continue on 

David DeWitt doesn’t look like a farmer With his long hair scruffy beard and
t shirt hed fit in more at a Phish show than behind a plow But appearances
are deceiving and Davids comfy mien belies a passion that is influencing the
culture of northern Cape Cod 
To wit in David helped launch the Truro Ag Fair
    an event that exceeded all expectations and brought
huge crowds to local farmers booths He runs the Rock Spray nursery a
Certified Natural provider of evergreens and ornamentals And he manages the
First Light Organic Farm a lush green spot in a hollow of North Truro Here 
David and his partner 
Arthur Teubner work year round growing heirloom and hardy fruits and
veggies to sell at market 
Davids a dedicated and inspired agrarian whose passion for farming keeps him
optimistic But farming on the Outer Cape is the sort of Sisyphian challenge
that can wear anybody out 
The hard truth 
The soil of North Truro is not strong enough to support agriculture Without
fertilization it deteriorates shockingly fast 
David points out a patch of sand with a thin strip of fertile loam along the
edge Last season it was a fertile veggie bed    but it was left un fertilized
as an experiment 
 This is what happens   David says  You have to keep feeding it
organic material or it turns back into sand  




This plot was a test run left untended for a single
season Last years rich loam is now useless sand 

Its always been this way in North Truro The Outer Cape is really just a spit of
sand    but still farmers lived here for generations How 
Salt marsh hay 
There used to be a local tradition in this area at each spring tide the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes
to harvest the grasses This was called  salt marsh haying  
Salt marsh hay has no weed seeds and it doesn’t compact as heavily as other
types of hay This makes it an excellent and bountiful source of compost and it
was used for generations as a soil enricher But haying had to happen regularly 
says David 
 Theres so much oxygen in this soil any added compost gets burned up in six
weeks All the nutrients get depleted  
That means soil left for two months without fresh compost will become    you
guessed it    sand 
The only way to keep things going here is to keep a steady flow of compost coming
in That means truckloads of hay and that means a lot of work Last year David
and Arthur brought in a semi truck loaded with leaf mulch It worked    but it
cost money and it disappeared fast into the hungry ground Not a long term
plan 
In bygone times the whole town of North Truro would pitch in on haying days 
now Davids on his own Without that community support its nearly impossible
for him to harvest hay often enough to keep the farm green 
Meanwhile in Tourist Town USA 
The Provincetown farmers market has lovely produce but little of it was grown on
the Cape 
Provincetowns official population of 
supports a tourism industry that serves millions of visitors each year City
folk marvel at the quaint charms of the Cape its idyllic beauty and simple
pleasures And then they go out to eat 
Even if tourists were interested in sustainable food they totally don’t care theyd be hard pressed to find a locally sourced
meal Raina Stefani serves Davids produce at her restaurant Terra Luna but it only makes up a
portion of her fares the rest has to be shipped from the mainland You cant
squeeze blood from a stone and you cant get big vegetable crops from sand
dunes End of story 
Well not exactly 
David isn’t giving up    in fact he’s got plans and ideas to refashion North
Truros farming community Hence the Ag Fair and the ongoing experimentation
with varieties and soils at First Light David isn’t alone he’s got the support
 and companionship of a growing group of gamechangers If the young farmers and
foodies of Truro can organize they might just be able to get local agriculture
back on its feet 
Their main opponent  The tourism and real estate industries which insist upon
turning every arable inch of the Cape into somebodys backyard The same
population that would consume the food produced here is actively inhibiting its
production 
No surprise there After all whats the point of farming on the beach

If someone could start bedding the outer capes horses with this Hay Straw 
You know they could It would be even better for the system This would
also make it more profitable The horses would be heathier They wouldnt
have to be standing on the acidic sand all of the time The straw hay could
also be a form of supplemental food for livestock horses which has been
used in before times The straw should be separated from the manure and
dried in the air then buised by hooves Then it is more ready to be mixed
with the soil in the spring

Zombies and Vampires and Ninjas and Pirates
 Jul 
by Rick
Its tough to kill the vampire genre
I was noodling on Vampires the other day but also lumped Zombies Pirates and Ninjas
in the mix These archetypes seem different to me than other trends Surely the
Vampire was dead after the spoof  Love at First Bite   in But then the Anne Rice  led revival brought it
back technically the st book Interview with the
Vampire was published in but didn’t gain widespread popularity until
later Then it jumped the shark with the Tom Cruise Brad Pitt movie based on the Anne Rice novel in But
bubbling below the surface was Blade and other genre flicks then Twilight hit and now vampires are hot 
 Surely Ninjas were done with horrible movies like American Ninja or with
comedies starring Chris Farley Beverly Hills Ninja and yet Ninja has become a replacement word for
expert to the point where its almost accepted parlance A twellow search for
ninja turned up more than Twitter accounts using the term in their
profiles Ninja Warrior is one of the
most popular shows on G 
We can put Pirates away now after the rd Pirates of the Caribbean flick right  No actually if weve learned
anything its that genre memes just go back underground Pirates for adults NSFW You get
the point These characters are like Zombies pun intended they just keep coming
back to life 
So its not just a matter of knowing when to jump off the Vampire merry go round 
its knowing when and where to jump back on If you jumped off Vampires would you
have known to jump back on in time to publish Twilight  Fourteen literary agents
rejected it before Stephenie Meyer got a deal If you were off Zombies would you
have gotten back on it time to publish NY Times bestseller Pride Prejudice and Zombies   I don’t think you can  get off  any
of these you have to triangulate your decision across several nodes of popular
culture a triangulation that has to revolve around the audience young adult   
Twilght mature    True Blood and sub genre comedy horror sci fi and then the
actual quality of the content So what sort of matrix board do you have to create to
know that a NC  comedy horror Zombie video game will work but a PG  young adult
time travelling Vampire TV show wont  You cant All you can do is hope you bat
 and that when you fail you fail
fast 
Ahh the classics 
If you broaden your scope a bit I think it would be difficult to find a time over
the last years or so when any of these four archetypes didn’t have a level of
bubbling popularity via books comic books tv movies video games music If all
youre looking at is or content categories maybe it looks like theyre dead but
they may be flourishing elsewhere and like a virus theyre just waiting for a new
host to carry them to the mainstream Publishers producers editors TV
execs they all have to calibrate their decisions based on so many factors and yet
even with access to sophisticated data it often comes down to human factors A gut
instinct that something is going to work Somebody at AMC is greenlighting The Walking Dead based partly on historical evidence that says people like
Zombies but also partly on the notion that this particular iteration will have a new
twist that will bring new people into the zombie and
AMC tent Personally i’m waiting for someone to make Pirate Zombies v Ninja
Vampires Hey if they can make Aliens and Cowboys anything is possible 
This post was inspired by a recent post by Grant
McCracken Make sure you read that one too

A defense of Michael Moore and  Bowling for Columbine  Op Ed By Eloquence Wed Aug th at AM EST 

This is an open letter to David Hardy author of Bowling for Columbine Documentary or Fiction  probably the most comprehensive among many rebuttals of the Oscar winning documentary Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award Their chances are small however as their arguments rely on polemic exaggeration and misrepresentation    in other words on the same techniques which they accuse Moore of using 
Dear David Hardy 
It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary In a time of simple minded patriotism loud clear and dissenting voices like Mr Moores are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced partially through well funded public relations campaigns partially through conservative  grass roots  propaganda Not surprisingly much of the criticism of Moores film is misguided or outright wrong often vastly more inaccurate than Moores work itself 

Moore portrays the NRA as an unethical dishonest organization he sees the paranoia and fear in the United States as a primary cause of violence and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem His documentary is full of subtle humor jaw dropping dialogue and dark contrasts All in all it is an accurate portrayal of Americas gun and violence culture It also raises questions about Americas foreign policy of recent decades questions which have been all but ignored by Moores critics 
On your webpage you state that  Moores resolution is questionable After all early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence    because Canadians like and Japanese positively love those If violent movies and violent videogames cannot cause violence    then how can newscasts about violence do so   
This is a faulty generalization If as Moore implies although never states as fact video games and violent movies are relatively harmless it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless There is a huge difference for example between playing a game like  Quake  and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now The latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash a genocide in Rwanda in which killed people Similarly the main motivation for the crusades beyond the promise of wealth was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved 
Obviously media propaganda can incite people to kill Interactive fiction like video games on the other hand presents violence in a narrative context which may very well desensitize participants to said violence but no causative link has ever been proven Moores hypothesis which apparently comes at least in part from the book  Culture of Fear  by Barry Glassner also advertised on Moores website is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia which itself can lead to violent acts This is consistent with the kind of media incited violence described above and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence It is no surprise however that US and European media do not question their own propaganda of fear 
Moores second hypothesis is that Americas foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists Children who grow up in war torn regions are known for having similar views    war is perceived as a normal part of existence violence as a natural way to solve disputes In a weaker sense the same message is projected to American children who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how  the enemies of freedom  are punished Moores film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show 
 They squealed like little piggies too so youll have to make do with oink oink squeeeeeeeallll for their last words That goes for your grandson Mustafa too by the way Still think fucking with the U S was a good idea Sammy   
Mustafa was years when he was killed Americans cheer the killing of children yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moores film seeks to address 
Inaccuracies 
Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moores movies It is true that Moores film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades let’s look at some specific criticisms 
 The bank scene listed on your website on a separate page Critics have stated that this scene was  staged  but in the bank interview the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about weapons at any given time It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks In an interview with the Wall Street Journal linked from your site an employee claims that the gun would have been  normally  picked up at another dealer It is not explained what  normally  is supposed to mean but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore 
The only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe According to the same WSJ interview  Typically you’re looking at a week to days waiting period   This is plausible    but entirely irrelevant for the movie which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed Moores detractors have sometimes extended those   days to several weeks contradicting the banks own estimate 
There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene The bank does exactly what it advertises It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation a bank handing out guns to its customers higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious 
 The Lockheed Martin interview This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often and it also the most inaccurate First the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly The dialogue goes as follows 
Moore  So you don’t think our kids say to themselves gee dad goes off to the factory every day   he builds missiles These are weapons of mass destruction Whats the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School   
McCollum PR person  I guess I don’t see that specific connection because the missiles that you’re talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us   
First note the word  our  in Moores question Moore is not from Colorado    his question is generic not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question McCollum understands it this way    otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized However critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollums response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant 
Even Lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible In response to one Moore detractor McCollum wrote  Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U S we make no weapons at the Littleton area facility Moore visited   Of course critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military and that the company is the nations largest military contractor As Moore correctly points out it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence    children learn by imitating adults 
Yes Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant    but he makes no incorrect statement It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication but in doing so they themselves have unlike Moore made many incorrect claims 
 Denver NRA meeting Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards 
First the  from my cold dead hands  part This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes shown on national TV even here in Germany It tells viewers Aha this is the person we are talking about Nowhere does Moore say or imply that these words were uttered at the rally in Denver and in fact their reptition later in the movie at another occasion oddly claimed by critics to be again  misattributed  is simply a reminder of this It is Moores way to say Viewers meet Charlton Heston gun nut extraordinaire 
The  visual of a billboard and a narration  is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together when in reality it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver Moore is a professional filmmaker    he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites and to accomplish that effect uses subtle interludes instead of long winded introductions This is a common technique but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking they believe critics who claim that he is  distorting  the interview What he does is standard filmmaking practice 
The same goes for the interview which follows Moores critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of  balance  The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so They were right You claim that there was  no way to change location since you have to give advance notice of that to the members and there were upwards of members   days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date had the NRA really wanted to It is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money not to piss off the victims of Colubmine That does not change the fact that they did just that Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff This is what good documentary filmmaking is about And here the critics again ignore important evidence 
When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver the crowd boos loudly Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayors letter only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request    not mentioning at all the reasons you have given This booing by the crowd not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there    and they effectively said  Fuck you  To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moores critics 
 The Kayla Rolland case Again critics like yourself charge Moore with deception The rally took place on October the shooting on February Again standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion  Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum    with completely false ideas It is brilliantly if unethically done   As noted above the  from my cold dead hands  part is simply Moores way to introduce Heston Did anyone but Moores critics view it as anything else  He certainly does not  attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered  and as noted above doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is 
Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland you write  There is no indication that Heston recognized Kayla Rollands case   This is naive to the extreme    Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview he certainly knew about the case at that point 
Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase   hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead  This is one valid criticism but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be rather it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moores fast pace editing The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there as will become quite obvious but simply to highlight the first mention of the name  Kayla Rolland  in the text which is in this paragraph 
Unfortunately because the zooming is rather fast it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence so as you correctly note some viewers got an incorrect impression It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website However the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons 
a Moore clearly states that  before he came to Flint  Heston gave an interview In the excerpt from said interview we can see that it is from March If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers why would he say this and show the month the interview was published  
b Why should Moore leave the words  Clinton is on the Today Show  visible in the text which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part  I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing 
c Both the  soccer mom  interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact The camera lingers on Bush Cheney posters and the protestor is quoted as saying that  we wanted to let the NRA know that we havent forgotten about Kayla Rolland  You make the hysterical claim that the interview  may be faked  on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee but if Moore had faked it why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestors mouth which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kaylas death  Why did Moore the masterful deveiver not edit this sequence out  This makes no sense 
Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nations youngest school shooting months after the fact but this sequence of  Bowling  is without doubt the most unfair to Heston The claims of deliberate distortion don’t hold up when viewing the whole scene though    as  Hanlons Razor  states one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions which is unfortunate but Moores critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly Had they done so Moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe In any case at no point does Moore make a false statement in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is  full of lies  
 You write  Having created the desired impression Moore follows with his Heston interview   No he doesn’t You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology yet you have no problems changing it yourself The Heston interview is at the very end of the movie After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston where he is asked about Kayla Rolland again clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRAs presence then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch entirely ignored by critics of the film who also mentions Hestons presence as notable and refers to the immediate reactions of  people from all over America  gun owners groups who according to him reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating These people do not feel the need to express sympathy or to think about ways to avoid such incidents but they feel the need to assert their  rights  and to look for quick simple answers    as Busch states gun owners wanted to  hang the child from the highest tree  This is all not mentioned by critics of Moores movie who claim to be objective 
Perhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding Moores film is your sub essay  Is the end of the Heston interview itself faked   
Moore answers a simple question    how could the scene have been filmed    with a simple answer two cameras From this you construct an obscure conspiracy of  re enactment   For all we can tell Moore could have shouted Hey to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left   Even if your  re enactment  theory is true and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion this itself is not unethical and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview You use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion 
 Animated history of the US Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely That the strategy to promote  gun rights  for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish Did the th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people  I highly doubt it But if they didn’t one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK This is the key message of this part of the animation which is again being ignored by its critics 
 Buell shooting in Flint You write  Fact The little boy was the class thug already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil and had fought with Kayla the day before  This characterization of a six year old as a pencil stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moores film warns against It is the typical right wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset The kid was a little bastard and the parents were involved in drugs    case closed But why do people deal with drugs  Because its so much fun to do so  It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American  contras  
It is equally well known that the so called  war on drugs  begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population both in relative and absolute numbers 
In poor areas the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort But the real cause here are not the drugs themselves but poverty and the  war on drugs  
Had the boys mother not been shipped to a  welfare to work  program she might at least have had some time to spend with her son Virtually every child psychologist knows that mother child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities the awareness of the consequences of ones actions and the learning of conflict resolution by non violent means Even the official quoted by Moore blames the welfare to work program knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring Once again your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moores and Buschs assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes 
Thats because while there is a so called war on drugs there is no war on poverty Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural and the poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCR owners who are just too lazy to work 
In reality what Moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen to the detriment of families 
It is notable that the Wall Street Journals reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours It called Moores claim  preposterous  How could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens  
 Taliban and American aid After the September attacks it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave million dollars to the new evildoers du jour Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation but because of the Talibans violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid    the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraqs Saddam Hussein Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moores website about the film 
 Gun homicides Statistics are Moores weakest point and it is surprising that his critics don’t dwell on them longer that’s because they know all too well that Moore is correct The United States have a far greater homicide rate both gun  and non gun than most other first world countries His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources and as you correctly point out he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite com website 
Not surprisingly guncite too compares data from different years    as I know from personal experience it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned according to guncite are 
Japan per England Wales per Germany per Australia per United States per 
Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make    concluding that gun ownership  leads  to violence In fact Moore mentions several counter examples and more such counter examples can indeed be cited It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence    but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John  Mary  Lott 
The gun control movement on the other hand distracts from the real causes of violence    poverty paranoia the  war on drugs  and antisexuality If these causes were addressed gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem but also unnecessary just like it is in Switzerland 
 Canada ammunition purchase You write 
Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart He asks us to  look at what I a foreign citizen was able to do at a local Canadian Wal Mart   He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised  Thats right I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted in Canada Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal 
Once again you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and  faking  a word which  Canadian officials  have never used for such a distortion Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson there is nothing fraudulent about that He made no claims whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification His claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarkets is independent from that claim 
 Hestons allegedly implied racism You conclude from Hestons own words that Heston was somehow portrayed as racist If anything it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with  having a more mixed ethnicity  Hestons answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition if he is unable to defend the interests of the NRA he should not be their spokesman In this case Hanlons Razor can be applied to Heston    he is probably not racist but incompetent Your accusations of inappropriate cutting are once again entirely unsupported    in fact it is quite clear from watching that particular scene that there is not a single cut from the point at which Moore asks Heston a second time for the cause of the higher violence in the States and the point when he mentions the Kayla Rolland incident If Heston makes himself look like a fool that should hardly be blamed on Michael Moore 
Conclusion 
You write  Bowling for Columbine is dishonest It is fraudulent To trash Heston it even uses the audio video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewers mind to a wrong conclusion   None of this is true What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture It is not a flawless diamond    the   hours  scene in particular suffers from bad editing the statistics are suboptimal and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves Other than towards the NRA the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions and comes up with some thoughtful answers The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film he would have used other material photos from Americas Emergency Rooms 
Certainly Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today and his film fully deserved its Oscar The shrill and remarkably unsuccessful Internet campaign to  revoke  his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the films accuracy It is not only the highest grossing non music documentary of all time among the users of the largest Internet film database IMDB it is also the highest rated one According to the LA Times the documentary genre  owes a huge debt to Michael Moore     after Bowlings success films like  Spellbound  and  Capturing the Friedmans  were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely 
But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason His next project has the working title  Fahrenheit   The temperature at which freedom burns  and he intends to launch it shortly before the next US presidential election It is unlikely however that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact After all the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous record holding documentary  Roger Me  by Michael Moore

 Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot Colony Infiltration and Task Switching
 Sonia Roberts
     
 Introduction
 
 Background
 Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years Unfortunately as of yet no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society Infiltrating insect societies however is much simpler Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees ants and cockroaches and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already Halloy et al No robot has yet been constructed however that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them Such a robot would allow for both long term studies of ant robot interactions and studies of task switching in the robots I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot hereafter referred to as Antie that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest switching between the foraging patrolling and midden work behaviors 
 
 Environment
 The red harvester ant lives in hot dry deserts building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain The ants forage for more than different varieties of seeds many of which do not grow in the desert Gordon where only a few varieties of small shrubs small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow Gordon Other insects and creatures including other species of ants are present in the desert but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals Gordon   Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive Gordon Because of this I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie and will not create a fighting behavior Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil 
 
 The Ant the Robot
 Ants of this species are of two types breeding ants queens and drones and sterile female workers Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season which occurs but once per year The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories brood care nest maintenance patrolling and foraging Little is known about brood care as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest midden work occurs close enough to the surface to be observable Patrolling and foraging too occur for the most part outside of the nest and have therefore been studied extensively ex Schafer et al Gordon et al Gordon Gordon It is therefore these three behaviors that I would like to focus on in this proposal the others remain a bit too mysterious to yet model and the ability of a robot to pass undetected in the depths of a colony would be very difficult to observe 
 These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler though there is some overlap particularly with navigational problems In the case of midden work Antie must be able to identify garbage grasp it carry it out of the nest and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum or until stimulated to switch behaviors Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub behaviors nest patrolling and trail patrolling An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers who may then upon smelling the returning patroller be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest wander around searching for food sources identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow Gordon   Holldobler et al as cited in Webb In addition to following these trails to the food foragers must also be able to identify food grasp it and carry it back to the nest Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task walk navigate both within and outside of the nest and of course switch tasks at appropriate times 
 
 The Agent 
 
 Chassis
 Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C for which some pseudocode is included Sensors will include a thermometer photoreceptors bump sensors a polarization compass and a series of chemical receptors Antie be a circular robot no more than cm in diameter the length of a red harvester ant with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors sonar detectors and chemical emitters including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance For the purposes of this proposal I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached Fig 
 
 Sensors
 In order to inform itself about its environment Antie will need a number of sensors In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible these sensors include a thermometer photoreceptors bump sensors and sonar a polarization compass and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae On its front grippers Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function 
 The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above degrees Celsius Gordon and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in nest navigation 
 Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ants eyes These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night Gordon 
 The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation and the bump sensors will when depressed also initiate the escape function The sonar will correspond to the ants limited optical object detection ability and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions 
 The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at and   degrees from the center front of Antie respectively that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants eyes sensitive to polarized light and research has shown that many insects including ants do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer Labhart et al Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos Moller Labhart Pfeifer and Wehner in consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers Fig The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest Upon each exit from the nest Antie will take a single o scan of the sky and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning 
 
 
 
 
 Fig Diagram of the polarization opponent unit described by Lambrinos et al The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarization sensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes The e vector heading returned from the two polarization sensitive photodiodes follows a cos  function 
 
 Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae and to mimic this Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting stalks with which to both interact with other ants who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae and take in chemical information These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n alkene levels present in another ants cuticular hydrocarbons which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmates current task perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun causing a different ratio of n alkanes to n alkenes and the presence of branched n alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile Wagner et al as cited in Gordon Greene Anties stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate Arnold et al as cited in Gordon Mehdiabadi receptors to detect food and receptors for three types of pheromones those released by successful foragers returning with food those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest and those marking piles of trash as midden Research shows that successful foragers returning to the nest do have a different effect on the inactive workers than unsuccessful foragers returning Schafer et al Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns Gordon and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest Gordon Greene Greene Gordon Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species Gordon For the purposes of this proposal I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks with four of each type of receptor per stalk This technique described by Ishida et al has been shown to improve the chemical plume tracking abilities of robots The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the on board PC 
 Finally Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson et al Patent and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage These will correspond to the muscles of the ants mandibles which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects A table of the sensors and their relation to the ants sensory system is provided below

 Motors
 Anties motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers emulating the grasping power of the ants mandibles A third motor will lift and lower the grippers allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs These will be located in different places the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section 
 
 The Behavior
 
 Antie will have a hybrid software architecture a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors but many sub behaviors will operate on a schema basis Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible and where appropriate different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked 
 
 Common Behaviors
 A few sub behaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior To ease Anties on board memory requirements and processing capabilities and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand I propose a few global variables and subroutines

 Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside in nest navigation an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into object identification and gripping a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following and the identification of other ants 
 For a simple start the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed 
 
    Forward cruise
    Takes in a number representing the desired speed 
    Causes robot to cruise forward at said speed 
    Speeds assumed to be on a   scale being fastest 
 
 void forCruz double speed  
    Each wheel input  gets  the appropriate speed
    Calibrate is a double representing a calibration
    initialized to zero and altered as necessary 
 
    The robot will receive the  GO command as long as
    this function is running 
 
 left motor OP   speed   calibrate 
 right motor OP   speed 
      end forCruz
 
 A similar rotate function will be used to orient Antie towards a particular heading 
 
    Rotate
    Takes in a desired angle to rotate the robot and 
    rotates accordingly
    Assume that s is sufficient to rotate the robot 
    completely around one wheel this may be changed 
    in implementation 
 
 void rotate int angle  
    If angle to turn is to the right rotate left wheel 
    for a portion of s in accordance with desired 
    angles proportion of a circle
 if angle>  
 while timer < angle    
 left motor OP   
 right motor OP   
 
    else rotate right wheel for appropriate portion of s
 else  
 while timer < angle    
 left motor OP   
 right motor OP   
      end while
      end else
      end rotate
 
 These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis and when combined with the forward cruise function should cause the robot to move at an angle 
 In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading and also how far from the nest it is at its current location The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos et al Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees positive or negative and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters The first function might look something like this 
 
    Nest Orient
    Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs
    and returns the location of the nest in degrees 
 int nestOrient double left POL IP double right POL IP  
 int degrees   
    Calculates direction of nest and returns as degrees 
 return degrees 
      end nestOrient
 
 The second function which would return the distance in centimeters might look something like this 
 
    Nest Distance
    Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs
    and returns the current distance to the nest 
 int nestDist double left POL IP double right POL IP  
 int dist   
    Calculates distance from nest returning distance in cm 
 return dist 
      end nestDist
 
 In nest navigation will be a function of the temperature read by Anties thermometer and a light source To exit Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight and to get deeper Antie will seek a lower temperature The code may look something like this 
 
    Exit Nest
    Uses temperature gradient to navigate towards the nest
    entrance from inside
 
 void nestExit  
    Reads temperature scoots forward s reads temperature
    again takes the difference and determines whether current 
    heading is increasing temperature reading If not rotates    degrees and tries again 
 while photo IP < sunrise  
 double temp   temp IP 
 while timer <  
 forCruz 
  
 temp    temp IP 
 if temp> rotate 
      end nestExit
 
 To enter the nest such as at the end of a task Antie will perform the same function except it will seek a lower temperature instead of a higher temperature it will avoid light and it will only activate while Antie is less than cm from the nest entrance This void function will be called nestEnter and will take in no inputs 
 To avoid bumping into things including other ants Antie be provided with an escape function Each of Anties eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount and the sonar will cause it to rotate degrees in the opposite direction Regardless this will be a very simple function I will include one example 
 
    Escape
    Escapes from danger when bump sensors or sonar are 
    activated 
 
 void escape  
    Declare and initialize left bump sensors in 
    order from front to back 
 bump left 
 bump left 
 bump left 
 bump left 
    Declare and initialize right bump sensors in 
    order from front to back 
    Sonar sensors are globally declared 
 
 if bump left  
    reverse   at reduced speed 
 forCruz   
      and rotate 
 rotate 
  
      end escape
 
 Because this function responds to the sensors on Anties around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds 
 Before picking objects up however Antie will need to identify them This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell Objects will include midden and food The code may look something like this 
 
    Object Identification
    Identifies an object that has snuck up on the 
    unsuspecting robot 
 
 void objID  
    Declare and initialize front bump sensor 
    Sonar sensors are globally declared 
 
    Check inputs to determine which smell is strongest
    if food smell is detected at higher rate and 
    above the food threshold for detection Antie 
    assumes object is food
 while bump front    sonar left IP sonar right IP  
 if left midden IP   right midden IP 
 < left food IP   right food IP 
 left food IP   right food IP 
 > food threshold  
 food detect   true 
  
    if midden smell is detected at higher rate 
    and above threshold for midden detection 
    Antie assumes object is midden
 else if left midden IP   right midden IP 
 > left food IP   right food IP 
 left midden IP   right midden IP 
 > midden threshold  
 midden detect   true 
  
      end objID
 
 Once the object has been identified Antie may grip it and lift it A simple void function grip taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying A void function release will perform this same action in reverse 
 Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers and localize the source of food odors and midden odors Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on  antennae stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past Webb regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Anties four sensors on each stalk The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a  left IP or  right IP  Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenbergs aggressive type vehicle described in his book  Vehicles Experiments in Synthetic Psychology  as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell et al to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis 
 
    Follow Gradient
    Follows a generic chemical gradient seeking a higher
    concentration 
 
 void gradientFollow  
    Compares left and right inputs and activates opposite
    motor to a greater degree 
 if left IP > right IP  
 schema  
 rotate   
 forCruz 
      end schema
      end if
 if right IP > left IP  
 schema  
 rotate 
 forCruz 
      end schema
      end if
 else forCruz 
      end gradientFollow
 
 For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow findFood and findMidden All three are void and take no inputs 
 The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non nestmates Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest Research has shown that red harvester ants may identify the tasks nestmates are engaged in based on the ratio of n alkenes to n alkanes in their hydrocarbons and the presence or absence of branched n alkanes The difference in ratio is caused by the time ants spend outside in the sun which depletes their n alkene levels Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n alkene levels The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this 
 
    Ant Identification
    Identifies an ant that has snuck up on the 
    unsuspecting robot 
 
 void antID  
 while left sonar IP right sonar IP  
    Are hydrocarbons present  Is this a nestmate  
 if left hydrocarb IP   right hydrocarb IP 
 > hydrocarb threshold  
 nestmate detect   true 
    In what task is the nestmate engaged 
 if n alkene level is appropriate for a forager  
 forager detect   true 
  
 if n alkene level is appropriate for a patroller  
 patroller detect   true 
  
 if n alkene level is appropriate for a midden worker  
 midworker detect   true 
      If not midden work foraging or patrolling ignore
      If not nestmate ignore
  
      end antID
 
 Using these basic common behaviors more complex behaviors may be coded 
 Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony Gordon Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age ex Ingram et al and partially as a function of interactions with other workers ex Schafer et al Gordon Greene Gordon Younger ants work more inside the nest and older ants work more outside the nest As a result I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in Midden work which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside will occur first patrolling which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside will occur second and foraging will be the final behavior Finally I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors 
 The midden work behavior will be Anties default initial behavior It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise and will continue until the outside temperature reaches ­­­oC at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest As previously stated a midden worker must identify midden grasp it and carry it to the surface depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden A program encoding this behavior might look like this 
 
                                                           
    MIDDEN WORK
                                                           
    Antie will leave nest in the morning after sunrise 
    carrying bits of midden halfway down the nest mound
    and depositing them Antie will return to the nest and
    repeat this task until the temperature reaches above
    degrees Celsius 
 
 void midden  
 
    Initiated by sunrise stopped by temperature
 while photo IP > sunrise temp IP <  
    Find midden and identify any found objects If
    they are midden grip and carry outside nest 
 findMidden 
 objID 
 if midden detect  
 grip 
 nestExit 
    cruise to halfway down the nest mound
 while nestDistance <  
 forCruz 
  
 release 
    reset midden detect
 midden detect   
 nestEnter 
      end if
      end while
      end midden
 
 The second behavior patrolling involves two sub behaviors nest patrolling and trail patrolling Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes and reentering the nest This behavior will be implemented in two parts with a task switching algorithm based on age Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy Moron et al and that task switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages Ingram et al It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling In order to perform both of these functions Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig zag fashion as harvester ants do Gordon Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests territories Gordon   To control for this behavior Anties explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths Gordon The code may look something like this 
 
    Explore
    Takes in desired distance from nest to explore 
    in cm and moves in a slightly randomized zigzag 
    pattern
 
 void explore int distance int time  
    Local Variables
 int time     integer representing the time to 
    wander one direction
 int angle     integer representing number of 
    degrees to rotate
 int dir     integer representing the direction to 
    turn  right  left 
 
    Random number generator to add a bit of wanderlust
 RandomGenerator rGen   new RandomGenerator 
 
    While loop robot will keep zigging and zagging 
    for a set amount of time
 while timer < time  
 if ants distance from nest < distance  
    int time gets a random number of seconds 
    between and 
 time   rGen nextInt 
    int angle gets a random number of degrees 
    between and 
 angle   rGen nextInt 
 
    function call to rotation subroutine
    if dir is rotate to the right if dir 
    is rotate to the left 
 if dir    
 dir      dir changes direction  turn 
    left next time
 rotate angle    rotate to the right
   else  
 dir      dir changes direction  turn 
    right next time
 rotate  angle    rotate to the left
      end rotation call
 
    while loop to count down number of seconds 
    using a timer
 while timer < time  
    command to go forward is given
 goForward   
    call to forward cruise function 
    straight cruise
 forCruz 
      end timer while loop
      end distance from nest while loop
    if ant is approaching the desired distance 
    double back at angle to explore more 
 if ants distance from nest   
 distance   some small constant  
 rotate 
      end if
    Avoid leaving nest territory
 else if nestmate pheromones IP < very low threshold  
 while short timer  
 forCruz    explore a bit further
      end while
 rotate 
      end if
      end if distance from nest < distance 
      end explore
 
 Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again Trail patrollers will go much further until food sources are found and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow A general site of food is all that the patroller need find the foragers will dig through the sand for the food Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this note that part is on a schema basis 
 
                                                              
    PATROLLING
                                                              
   
    Main patrolling behavior function 
    Includes nest patrolling trail patrolling and the
    stimulation and thresholds to initiate and switch between
    the two 
 
    Nest Patrolling
    Patrollers first job of the day exit the nest and
    explore the nest mound taking measurements 
 void nestPatrol  
 while photo IP > light at sunrise 
 temp IP < degrees Celsius  
 nestExit 
    Nest mounds are generally up to m across
    Thus explore in a cm radius Gordon 
 explore 
 schema  
 rotate nestOrient 
 forCruz 
 nestEnter 
  
 wait a short time
      end if
      end nestPatrol
 
    Trail Patrolling
    Patrollers exit nest and attempt to find food Once food
    is found they mark a trail leading back to it while
    taking the most efficient route home 
 void trailPatrol  
 while photo IP > light at sunrise 
 temp IP < degrees Celsius  
 nestExit 
    Explore no further than about m from nest for no
    more than minutes
 if food IP > some low threshold  
 findFood 
 if food detect  
 schema  
 rotate nestOrient 
 forCruz

 else  
 explore 
 schema  
 rotate nestOrient 
 forCruz 
 nestEnter 
  
 wait a short time
  
      end if
      end trailPatrol
 
 For the task switching in the patrolling behavior assume some variable  age that Antie has been keeping track of using the CPUs clock pulses to track the time since its last bootup The integers nestpatrol age and trailpatrol age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks 
 
    PATROLLING
    Task switching hierarchy for the two types of patrolling
 void patrol  
 while age > nestpatrol age age < trailpatrol age  
 nestPatrol 
  
 while age > trailpatrol age age < forage age  
 trailPatrol 
  
  
 
 The final behavior foraging will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter clockwise The code for this adapted from Russells paper might look like this 
 
    Hex path search
    Localizes an object through sand using chemical detection
 void hexSearch  
 double intense   inensity at n  
 double intense   intensity at n  
 while nothing in grippers  
 if intense > intense 
 last rotation was counterclockwise 
   
 intense < intense 
 last rotation was clockwise  
 rotate   
 while short timer  
 forCruz 
  
      end if
 else  
 rotate 
 while short timer  
 forCruz 
      end while
      end else
      end while
      end hexSearch
 
 Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path Gordon To address this a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon The code might look like this 
 
                                                              
    FORAGING
                                                              
   
    Main foraging behavior function 
    Foragers will exit the nest upon activation and follow
    a trail laid by the patrollers Upon completion of the
    trail following will locate and grip food returning
    to the nest Boolean forage today represents Anties
    activation status for each day once it has switched to 
    the foraging behavior 
 
 void forage  
    Wait for a successful patroller to return 
 if sucpat detect forage today   true 
 while forage today temp IP <  
 nestExit 
 trailFollow    Follow successful patroller trail 
    Note that this is NOT a schema basis which would 
    cause Antie to stop and retrieve food encountered en 
    route 
    When end of plume is reached retrieve food 
 while food detect  
    while food has not yet been found continue searching 
    and identifying found objects
 hexSearch 
 objID 
  
    Once that loop has been broken return to nest
 schema  
    grip food and return to nest
 grip 
 rotate nestOrient 
 forCruz 
 nestEnter 
  
    release food just inside nest entrance
 release 
      end while
      end forage
 
 Of course what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task switching between these larger behaviors Because the midden work behavior is Anties initial default behavior I will not address task switching to midden work Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Anties CPU that will count its  age since last boot To remind the reader this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers returns with great accuracy by Schafer et al and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers Gordon Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate According to Schafers et al model of forager activation every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit a fraction modeled at of inactive foragers joins the queue For the purposes of modeling Antie I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent irreversible and partly a function of age with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers The code to model this task switching might look something like this 
 
                                                              
    TASK SWITCHING
                                                              
   
    Main function of Anties software Examines the task 
    switching criteria and determines when Antie will perform 
    what behavior Int  age is an integer representing the
    time since Anties last boot corresponding to the age
    of an ant being simulated Int nestpatrol age refers to the 
    starting age at which Antie will begin to nest patrol 
    forage age refers to the starting age at which Antie may be 
    activated to forage This would correspond to the change in 
    gene expression described by Gordon 
 
 main  
    default to midden work
 while age < nestpatrol age  
 midden 
      end while
    switch to patrolling behavior based on age
 while nestpatrol age < age age < forage ave  
 patrol 
      end while
    switch to foraging as a function of time but 
    remain inactive until stimulated by returning 
    successful foragers
    Assume that inactive foragers will not smell different 
    from patrollers which was their last task because 
    they have not yet spent sufficient time in the sun 
 if sucfor detect at time n     false 
 sucfor detect at time n     
 probability forage active   true 
  
 
 while age > forage age forage active  
 forage 
  
      end main
 
 
 Conclusion
 
 Antie will be a fully autonomous situated and embodied agent infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants behaviors and their task switching thresholds but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance

 Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America 
 The Rediscovery of Language and Identity
 Humans in the process of defining themselves look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture a group of people joined by characteristics traits and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity discernible from that of those  outside them those who do not belong Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things   clothing food lifestyle choices One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language The command of a language while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it is often the key to gaining entry In turn communal identity can be formed around a language it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in th century Latin America the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their  indigenous identity and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages 
 The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far reaching and deeply embedded in both countries One of the most prominent lasting influences is that of the land grant system Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land This was in turn replaced by the repartimento the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish providing labor and taxes as demanded In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish resulting in modern day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists Warren   Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early th century Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations previously both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture The Marxists on the contrary argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity However they also claimed that they were part of a larger group the working class whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker friendly one Jackson   
 In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples This is similar to the situation of Guatemala the government felt it needed to battle communism an  armed and dangerous menace within plunging the country into civil warfare in the s and continuing through the s Warren This resulted in persecution against the Mayans who make up about of the overall population In both counties guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples in many cases there were coalitions but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote inaccessible villages as hideouts In Guatemala over villages were destroyed Mayans were killed and over million more were displaced The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in with the establishment of a peace accord Warren   
 The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements By the s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen and indigenous rights movements formed Warren Jackson Central to these was the question of indigenous identity largely lost amidst the overwhelming Spanish influence local leaders sought to rediscover their native roots and redefine what it meant to be a part of indigenous culture Pan Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language despite local dialectical differences it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people Most still speak it in various forms and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent modern version of Maya England Pan Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity it largely avoids specifically political overtones instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture England The popular left however continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse The Pan Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the often negative attention of the government England Warren A main concern among pan Mayanists is the reversal of the long seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior Pan Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance a language of power and prestige England By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority 
 Colombia in contrast has no unified  pan Indian  sentiments the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population a fractured entity divided by region and language Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan Indian group yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples Jackson The CRIC which focuses on language development and renewal is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples Jackson It often stands in conflict with the AICO its Guambiano counterpart Jackson   Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups Jackson The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre colonial times therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best Rappaport This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other In the s the rhetoric of  cultural diversity  was picked up the Colombian media and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole 
 A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of which includes a section on indigenous rights as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups Gow and Rappaport Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups it is now used to support them resguardos or communally owned plots of land are granted to communities They are ruled by the cabildo local governing boards formed of community leaders Gow and Rappaport   The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature Gow and Rappaport   
 The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of Mayans gained formal recognition in as the majority population in a precursor to the peace accord by its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution Warren   It failed despite the Mayan majority possible reasons include the overwhelming illiteracy rates among the indigenous population and inaccessibility of voting stations Warren However it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution Warren Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone England Nonetheless in the legislature passed the law of national languages which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion While largely symbolic it is still significant in that Guatemalan identity is seen as encompassing languages other than Spanish 
 This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia Within the pan Mayan movement there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity some view the reduction of their language to the status of  dialect  devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world however despite differences over standardization the pan Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive In contrast Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued but serves to split the population both between groups and within groups themselves An example is the Tukanoans while considered a single  ethnic group they maintain distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy in which members of one language group must marry into another Jackson 
 Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture Indigenous cosmology or  cosmovision is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages it maintains a concept of culture defined as  the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature Gow and Rappaport and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non governmental organizations The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with It is necessary to work within the national legal system in order to gain policy reform beyond the local level however with widely differing concepts of justice a a balance is difficult to achieve Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony crimes are viewed as imbalances in the communitys harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime but may have influenced the accused to do so When a punishment   often public and corporal in nature   is carried out the group feels the effects as a whole Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence sharing in their ordeal Rappaport Once punishments are completed the criminal is seen as rehabilitated having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order and is welcomed back into the community Gow and Rappaport Rappaport 
 Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution but to recapture its spirit in a native rather than Western discourse Gow and Rappaport   This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing Rappaport Translation fulfills another vital role as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten Rappaport 
 This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use Difficulties arise however as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought In addition there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity the Nasa for example divide themselves into the traditional modern and new The authenticity of the modern Nasa who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots is brought into question by the traditional who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence Rappaport In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions which most often occurs under Spanish influence 
 A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic  Indianness both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not  Indian enough it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse leading to distrust among indigenous peoples Jackson Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences Efforts towards development then cannot endanger traditional culture and values for fear of losing cultural legitimacy Jackson There develops a duality in native culture for example many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom An emphasis on preserving rather than practicing native culture arises indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day to day basis Gow and Rappaport   
 This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed In Guatemala they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress the pan Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law In Colombia legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian governments recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not Jackson Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws Jackson Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment

 Tonal Structure and Form in Bartóks Concerto for Orchestra I 
 Drew F Nobile
 University of Washington
 Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used Bartóks music although it is often difficult to call completely tonal never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure This remains true even with one of his last compositions the Concerto for Orchestra written two years before his death in The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement The analysis will treat the movement tonally investigating the progression of local  tonics and its relationship to the overall form We will also examine to what degree a  tonal reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common practice compositional techniques 
 Harmonic Structure and Form
 Bartók describes the form of the first movement as  more or less regular sonata form 
 Bartók 
 While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion it is perfectly accurate the movement is in sonata form but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement not unheard of in Mozart sonatas and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order The  backwards recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates 
 For example the fifth string quartet Also see Bartóks comments on that Bartók 
 Example shows a diagram of the form of the movement the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction As the example shows the development section is divided into three subsections the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition Hence on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG STG FTG which makes the overall form with the exception of the Introduction symmetric 
 Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement although his interpretation is somewhat different See Wilson

 example formal structure of the first movement
 Sonata form or  more or less sonata form carries harmonic as well as formal connotations While  tonality in this piece and in Bartóks music in general is quite different from its classical interpretation we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata form structure To begin with the movement is in F When we say  in F  we do not imply F major or minor for that matter  the major minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece but rather that the pitch class F is the tonal center of the movement and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement Using this interpretation we can map out the local tonics tonal centers used throughout the movement as shown in Example 
 
 
 
 example harmonic structure of the first movement
 In this example the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece Introduction Exposition Development­ Recapitulation  so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins Beginning with the exposition the large scale progression of tonal centers is a whole tone descent from F to F represented by the stemmed notes in Example while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph in a quasi bass Anstieg The middle pitch of the descent B acts as the  dominant to F based on its symmetrical division of the whole tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition Bartók has often applied a tonic dominant relationship to a pitch class and its tritone partner and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet 
 See Bartók   
 In this particular movement Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant C for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B this and other subtleties shown in Example will be explained in detail in later sections 
 
 
 
 Paul Wilson gives a detailed account of the foreground activity throughout this movement in his analysis we do not seek to duplicate or substitute for his findings Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure The graph in Example will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper 
 The Introduction
 As Paul Wilson points out the title  Introduzione given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first measures 
 Wilson 
 The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement in fact it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece To begin with the opening motive in the celli and basses shown in Example outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch class set and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale Indeed this set can be seen more as a by product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive Furthermore the following two instances of this opening motive shown in Examples and remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set 
 
 
 
 example measures   celli and basses

 Example transitions from C♯ to F♯ and adds pitch class E to the pentatonic set of Example creating a six note set of stacked fourths Example shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth the set created is a ten note set derived by stacking fourths 
 If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example 
 Each note is either approached or left or both by a fourth and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯ The overall motion in the first measures is C♯ to D♯ through F♯ these are represented enharmonically in Example as D♭ E♭ and G♭ As previously mentioned this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole tone descent from F to F So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a usually ascending perfect fourth We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths indeed the structural whole tone descent is often  filled in with the intervening fourth This motion is exemplified in Example in the second theme group mm   and as we will see it occurs in other places though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 
 Each time the motion in Examples through breaks from chains of fourths the same sequence of intervals occurs two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second       each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition shown in measures   of Example So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement within the first measures we can already see structural harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole 
 The section from measures   is centered on E upon the return of D♯ enharmonically respelled as E♭ in measure we see that E acts as its upper neighbor This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures   however while there is no clear tonal center for this section G appears in the outer voices in measure although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor The concluding motive of this section in the violins the bracketed sections of Example as well as the bass motive of measure ff Example are related to the first head motive of the first theme which is shown in the first measure of Example All three of these motives span a tritone which as mentioned is the  dominant relationship in this movement Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as  quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated 
 Wilson 
 but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition

 The Exposition
 Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over As mentioned the first theme the beginning of which is reproduced in Example contains two head motives the first is the tritone spanning ascent that appears in the first measure and the second is an iteration of the interval cell       that appears in the second through third measures While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation Rather this motive is a small scale representation of the tonic dominant relationship of tritone partners specifically F and B that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement

 Rhythmically we have a dissonance between the melody which follows the written meter and the accompanying chords in the bassoons horns and lower strings Example reproduces the chords and Example rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern As Example shows the chords are more or less in duple meter   and   with one  hiccup occurring in the   measure This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody with its own  hiccups occurring in the written   measures As we will later see this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation

 We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F this is made clear from the onset both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures   these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F E♭ is the tonal center for measures   although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure Measures   contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E♭ where E♭ is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass Example illustrates this structure Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass C♯ D♭ is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme The trombone motive in measures   shown in Example is the subject of the fugato section in part of the development although its importance is downplayed here Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯ which fills in the whole tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯ C♯ B E with the addition of some passing tones in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths

 Wilson claims that C and E♭ are  local dominants to F in this first section of the exposition 
 Wilson 
 While the strong V I motion from measures   does carry a tonal implication of dominant tonic such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context E♭ furthermore is not convincingly established as a dominant functioning tone at all The passage from measures   is centered on E♭ and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function Rather we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground level whole tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure that is represented in Example In measures   the bass descends F E♭ D♭ C which might seem to support Cs functioning as structural dominant However as previously mentioned C acts as a  fake dominant that in measures   actually functions as an upper neighbor to B the  true dominant The descent in measures   in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge 
 The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple which is in stark contrast to the first theme B dominates as tonal center from measures   with little or no harmonic motion away from it Measures   are in E♭ with the bass notes in the harp and measures   are in D♭ A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure  another instance of the whole tone being  filled in by a fourth The return to B in measure is also filled in in this way by F♯ in measures   Hence measures   constitute the bass progression B E♭ D♭ B the same stepwise descent E♭ D♭ occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged Paul Wilson points out that   i n substituting for F within an analogous structure B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement 
 Wilson 
 In our terminology this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant 
 The Development
 As mentioned the development is divided into three subsections In Example the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole tone descent As Paul Wilson states the development  is for Bartóks music developmental in a relatively conventional way the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified and tonalities other than those expected arise 
 Wilson 
 The only slight abnormality though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical period sonata movements is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on  a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head motive of the first theme 
 Wilson 
 there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm contour and interval content are changed Furthermore this section being the middle section of the movement upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme 
 The first section of the development measures   begins with a big D minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure it returns to D minor in measure which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D The passage beginning at measure shown in Example can be considered to be the  theme of this section and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures   as  Z identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence       from the original motive 
 
 
 
 example measures   violins 
 The second section of the development is in C♯ which is sometimes spelled D♭ This section is reproduced as Example This section returns to the calm simplicity and tempo of the second section though apart from affect there are no references to that section Although the C♯ major chord in measure preceded by A♭ major V in measure suggests C♯ as tonal center the tonality is not strongly established until measure The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development Example which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯ 
 Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group we could conceive of C as a sub dominant in this movement As tempting as this interpretation may be this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms

 The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example transposed to begin on F and turns it into a fugato sequence reproduced in Example The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures   by the strong V I chord progression Example As previously mentioned the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme The resultant set is the pentatonic set F B♭ E♭ A♭ D♭ the entire passage shown in Example remains within this set The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth but the first note is B♭ rather than C which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center

 The second instance of the fugato section not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure The following section measures   especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A which intensifies the arrival on A and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large scale whole tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section

 The Recapitulation
 The recapitulation as we have seen presents the themes in reverse order The second theme is initially presented in A as part of the whole tone descent and proceeds directly to G where it is restated slightly modified It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure is led into by D which constitutes another  filling in of the whole step by the intervening fourth The A♯ in measure might initially seem to be a new tonal area but it leads to D in measure which constitutes a V chord still applied to G Rather than resolve this D back to G however Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure and leads to E in measure E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme measures   which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F which returns triumphantly in measure with the much anticipated recapitulation of the first theme 
 The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such however there are some important differences Firstly its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it the first chord in Example is an F minor triad and the first four notes of Example ascend the F minor scale In the recapitulation of this theme shown in Example the first chord is an F major chord and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody In fact the chord progression of the first four measures of Example can be thought of tonally as I vi V in F major while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major the conspicuous A♭ in measure easily brings doubt to this interpretation we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation 
 In addition to the  mode shift we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples and no longer appears notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example and also that the written meter no longer changes In other words the piece in becoming more regular is beginning to drive towards the finish because of the formal structure the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement Indeed this section has the feel of a Coda to it it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection and the tonic harmony is active throughout There are also no phrase divisions the music simply drives forward with no pause until measure where the fugato motive appears in the brass over an obvious V I cadence signaling the end of the movement which occurs as the motive completes

 There is no fine line between music that is  tonal and music that is  atonal  Bartók is one of the many early twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music their system however is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum But if we apply it to music such as Bartóks that is in the middle area we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions It is not disputed that Bartóks music has great expressive power perhaps now we can understand why

 Reaching Transcendence through the Elimination of color 
 The Ideal Minimalism of Black and White

 The world is made up of a myriad of colors color gives distinction to our life it
 gives flavor and meaning What would our lives be without color  At the same time in
 our modern society color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the
 enlightened mind and space color is seen as corrupting intoxicating disorienting
 and in art has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch We went from
 times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white
 were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence 
 What is the significance for this preference for black and white when it comes to
 high art  Why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our
 space  What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more
 specifically can black and white be considered non colors  
 Ever since the dawn of man human society has evolved in ways which attempt to
 ultimately control nature Seeing as color is something of the natural world age
 old and archaic washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above
 the physical world  Intelligent beings have a language represented by articulate
 sounds organized beings like all animals and vegetables express themselves by
 cries or forms contour or carriage Inorganic nature has only the language of
 color It is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or
 emerald  color then is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature 
 while drawing becomes the medium of expression more and more dominant the higher we
 rise in the scale of being Blanc Chromophobia p The history of color is
 about the ways in which man has tried to find the ideal state of being throughout the
 ages 
 In the Far East reaching a state of colorless ness is associated with the highest
 state of spiritual being the state of Zen What is typical of this sort of ascetism
 is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal This is
 apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and
 Japan For them reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in
 its most minimal form This reduction of color and expression proved the purity the
 artist had reached within himself it was a means of reducing down to the essence of
 a thing 
 In the Elimination of color in the Far East Izutsu explains though how this
 ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine
 knowledge of color  This artistic acestism i e the suppression of externals and
 the reduction of all colors to black and white manifests its real aesthetic
 function only against the background of a highly refined sensibility for colors and
 their subtle hues In other words the true profundity of the beauty of black and
 white is disclosed only to those eyes that are able to appreciate the splendors of
 sumptuous and glowing colors with all their delicate shades and tints Izutsu p 
 For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of
 color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors
 in themselves as non colors 
 It is through the absence of color that one brings to mind the colors that are no
 longer present It is up to the mind to fill in the blank space Without color one
 could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space colorlessness needs
 color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place  That is to say 
 under the total absence of color there is a vague reminiscence of all colors that
 have been  killed Izutsu p Black and white are the consummation of all
 colors into one  Black is life it is the infinite possibility of expression and
 development Black here is not sheer black For in its negation of all colors all
 colors are positively affirmed Izutsu p It is through these means that one
 finds the essence in a thing 
 In Western society this purging of color began with the rejection of ideals of
 generations past Eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the
 th century Society turned to minimalism as a way of cleansing life representing
 modernity color became a moral issue seen as something sensuous and dangerous in
 its secondary nature to the essence of life and form  The predominance of color at
 the expense of drawing is a usurpation of the relative over the absolute of fleeting
 appearance over permanent form of physical impression over the empire of the
 soul Chromophobia p color rests on the surface of an object it is
 superficial cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that
 thing 
 color is associated with the Fall from Grace It is something which speaks to the
 senses not the mind it is external and therefore secondary to life It deals with
 the body emotions not the intellect It strays from reason in the way which it
 consumes and manipulates life  color was a permanent internal threat an
 ever present inner other which if unleashed would be the ruin of everything the
 fall of culture For Charles Blanc color also represents a kind of ruination 
 color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization the
 nobility of the human spirit slowly heroically has lifted itself   but back into
 which it could always slide Chromophobia p It is a descent in the way it
 makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire and to
 desire is to lose control over oneself Thus began the cult of the black and white 
 White is seen as representing spirituality the heavens and light it is all which
 is modern it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color It is the
 control of nature and the body and represents the modern man 
  WHITE is the spiritual color of our times the clearness which directs all out
 actions It is neither grey white nor vory white but pure white 
 WHITE is the color of modern times the color which dissipates a whole era our era
 is perfection purity certitude 
 WHITE It includes everything 
 We have superceded both the brown of decadence and classiscm and the blue of
 divisionism the cult of the blue ky the gods with green beards and the
 spectrum 
 WHITE pure white  Chromophobia p 
 For these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of
 colors Abolishing color means controlling color  The white surface exposes
 color presents it for disciplining It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames 
 But before that it keeps an eye on itself watching its freshly laundered and neatly
 folded fabric for the stain of color Wigly p colorlessness is not natural 
 and thus proves mans superiority over this world 
 On the other hand we need color in order to distinguish black and white Just as
 those from the Far East the purity of white implies what has been washed away and
 thus makes the white glitter even more White and black stand out because of color 
 and color stand out because of white and black They are linked intrinsically
 together one cannot go without the other  White is the setting for color In a
 mosque for example the architectonic effect of its white garment is assisted by a
 strategic use of color  All these things are clothed in a majestic coat of
 whitewash The forms stand out clearly the impeccable construction displays all its
 boldness At times a high stylobate of delightful ceramic produces a blue vibration 
 The sensuous vibration of the color clarifies the white surface whose limit it
 marks Wigley p We need this opposition between color and non color to make
 distinction between the two otherwise neither would hold such significance White
 helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash it brings together and unites 
  White expresses a certain incorporeality The use of white is therefore decisive for
 the bodily appearance of a space Concrete bodies decrease the space more or less
 depending on their color value Against white one can actually establish the
 intensity of clashing colors white determines the tone in the first place Because
 of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize Wigley 
 p 
 For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and
 architectural spaces The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set
 before them It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours
 of the space  In the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and
 disposition was surest and most convincing all the details of the form and color of
 the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background In this a
 form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could
 be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in  closed
 spaces Wigley p 
 There is another important aspect which white is representative of and that is the
 well educated and socially elite In the th century it became fashionable for
 bourgeois women to dress in white while men dressed in black Wigley These
 distinctions proved a certain rational order only attained by those able to afford
 of it White walls white clothing they both require much more maintenance than
 something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors Crisp
 whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury and leisure White clothing
 proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work 
 for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women
 who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white while men who were the ones
 to go out and work wore black for black did in fact hide stains 
 The same goes with white walls in their impeccability it proved to whoever that the
 owner could afford to not live actually live in this space or could afford more
 simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint Both as well were signs of
 the modern age man had reached  Pure white was de rigueur partly because of its
 exciting novelty partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture and
 pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature Wigley p xvii The use of
 white was proof that man had conquered nature 
 The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of
 distinguishing oneself from the vulgar normal lower classes   it is also worthy
 of remark that savage nations uneducated people and children have a great
 predilection for vivid colors that animals are excited to rage by certain colors 
 that people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the objects that are
 about them and seem inclined to banish them altogether from their
 presence Chromophobia p Furthermore with the advent of industrialization
 the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for
 all classes Now anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began
 to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them 
 Thus said the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new
 bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the
 vulgarity from the low  In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie there
 long survived a tendency to limit the use of color with strong emphasis on what are
 generally thought of as non colors such as white black and gray The Style Engine 
 p Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in
 black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession
 with purity and cleanliness Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of
 labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society the wearing
 of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so This simplicity of dress
 was seen as a mark of the modern man 
 Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on
 this preference for black and white Photography took over as a means of portraiture
 for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to
 color the photographs for the most part they were left in black and white because it
 was seen as more  natural Above all it is believed that the expanse of literacy
 and the printed word mainly the newspaper had a profound effect in influencing the
 choice of black and white  This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform 
 a world in  black and white This led to the idea of writing   rationality  
 production that confined images especially images in color to the emerging field of
  art which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially
 unproductive while it assigned to the two toned and orderly world of printed paper
 the role of a daily guide to existence The Style Engine p The world of print
 was therefore seen as something serious for the modern man 
 Black and white became a symbol for the superiority of mans intellect and
 technology This then translated down into the world of fashion as seen with the
 distinction between black and white clothing as well as art namely photography but
 also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space 
 Seeing as since the time of Aristotle form was valued over that of color the arts
 which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form 
 The explosion of mass production and printing allowed for a plethora of colorful
 advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch  Kitsch is a product
 of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America
 and established what is called universal literacy Greenberg In order to meet the
 demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the
 attention of consumers Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it
 reproduced it d infinitum Greenberg continues by saying  Kitsch using for raw
 material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture welcomes and
 cultivates this insensibility It is the source of its profits Kitsch is mechanical
 and operates by formulas Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations Kitsch
 changes according to style but remains always the same Kitsch is the epitome of all
 that is spurious in the life of our times Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its
 customers except their money    not even their time With the advent of kitsch came
 a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms Avant guard at
 the time was considered to be true art while this kitsch was simply pure imitation 
 Thus said this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the
 cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious high art 
 while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes 
 Of course during the early stages of color film and photography the quality was so
 poor that it gave a cheap look whereas black and white film really allowed one to
 see the light and the shadows in the images For the play of light and form was key
 in demonstrating the true art form That was what made up the essence of an image 
 not the artificial or superficial filling in of form with color Color was thought
 to distract the viewer from the soul of the image 
 These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being
 almost better than reality Still though black and white is seen as something of a
 more sober tradition Photographers still use black and white and white is still the
 most widely used color for walls within gallery spaces These non colors allow for
 the appreciation of color When something is black and white it allows the mind to
 fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen 
 Many actually complained with the invention of color in movies that this stunted the
 mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors placed before them It is for
 this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an
 intellectual process It forces one to imagine it forces one to delve into the core
 of the object Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non
 color the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years 
 Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color but perhaps it
 is human instinct to want to surpass and rebel against generations before so
 possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration Thus is the ebb and
 flow of life 

 
 
 


 
 
 
 The debate over homosexuality has been one of the most long lasting and controversial
 ones ever What exactly causes homosexuality  Some would say it is a gene passed
 on from parents to child Others would argue that it is a result of a childs
 upbringing Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be
 cured Perhaps then it is a combination of some of these  No one knows for sure and
 it is possible no one ever will but that surely does not stop everyone from coming
 up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter 
 Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of
 the time where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence Emond 
 In his book The Symposium Plato wrote  Those who are halves of a man whole pursue
 males and being slices so to speak of the male love men throughout their boyhood 
 and take pleasure in physical contact with men qtd in Isay This shows that
 not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male he
 also believed that it began at a very young age as the word  boyhood signifies In
 fact Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only
  real and lasting love and necessary for democracy Furthermore there were many
 occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology Hercules is rumored to have
 had male lovers and Zeus himself partook in such behavior Even Homer wrote about
 Achilles and Patroclus who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love
 Emond 
 But it was not until that the term  homosexual was first used to describe  a
 man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex
 Marcus However for the purposes of this paper homosexuality will be looked at
 solely in terms of men At this point in time Karl Maria Kertbeny used the word in
 a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of Prussia 
 Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for  same and the Latin word for
  sex  whereas a heterosexual is a person whose feelings of sexual attraction are
 for the opposite sex Marcus 
 It was also in the s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was
 started by Magnus Hirschfeld a physician sex researcher leading sexologist 
 homosexual and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany who believed
 that homosexuality was biological in nature Marcus Hirschfeld also founded the
 Scientific Humanitarian committee which was mostly homosexual in The
 committee published many books and other forms of literature which gave Hirschfeld a
 great amount of prestige in his field He became known as one of the founding fathers
 of sexology and furthered this position when he opened the worlds first sexological
 institute the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin in which was destroyed
 by the Nazis years later Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl
 Ulrichs with minor additions he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of
 homosexuality but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to  cure homosexuals with
 the use of hormone injections This theory which defined Urnings as males who turned
 to other males as sexual partners was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs 
 starting in The first Vindex defended Urnings while the second Inclusa 
 which followed shortly after described the first scientific theory of homoerotic
 desire Ulrichs believed that Urnings were attracted to other males because they were
  hermaphrodites of the mind  meaning while they may have been male in body they
 were female in soul and mind leading them to be naturally attracted to males in
 terms of sexual partners This he claimed made laws such as paragraph a law
 adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their
 unification which forbade sex between males and forced criminal penalties upon
 individuals partaking in such behavior unfair and unreasonable Ulrichs claimed
 that the origin of such a disposition was natural and inborn Wikholm 
 A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer Sigmund Freud still believed
 homosexuality to be a natural behavior In an interview in he professed his
 beliefs  I am  of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick
 people  Homosexual persons are not sick They also do not belong in a court of law 
 qtd in Isay In he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous  Letter
 to an American Mother of a homosexual which stated that  Homosexuality is assuredly
 no advantage but is nothing to be ashamed of no vice no degradation it cannot be
 classified as an illness  Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern
 times have been homosexuals qtd in Isay 
 However the general public of the s and early s including the medical
 professionals regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness Treatments such as
 castration hysterectomy lobotomy and electroshock therapy were used as attempted
 cures By the mid s psychotherapy became the most common  cure  and many
 homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual
 preference Dudley 
 Dr Evelyn Hooker a heterosexual psychologist conducted a ground breaking study in
 the mid s that went along similar reasoning as Freud In this courageous
 experiment Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men half homosexual
 and half heterosexual She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that
 homosexuality was a mental illness and concluded that there was no significant
 psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men  gay men were no
 more insane than their  straight counterparts Marcus 
 Fortunately many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an
 illness and their lobbying along with the innovative study performed by Hooker who
 has been referred to as  the Rosa Parks of the gay movement convinced the American
 Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the
 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of Just over
 a year later the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from
 their list of mental illnesses Marcus The American Psychological Association
 further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of
 Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual
 Orientation in which publicly chastised those who attempted to  cure
 homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment It stated rather that
 homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person 
 but must still be respected as an individual orientation and thus treated as one
 Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation 
 Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in by Michael
 Bailey an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University and Richard
 Pillard an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of
 Medicine and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics For
 two years these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both
 monozygotic or identical twins a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg
 and thus having identical DNA and dizygotic or fraternal twins a set of twins
 from too separate zygotes causing them to have similar DNA but not any more so than
 that of two ordinary siblings in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males
 meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment In
 total pairs of twins identical and fraternal and sets of male and their
 adopted brothers were studied where at least one of the two had been classified as
 homosexual either by self identification or other means Out of the homosexual
 males who had identical twins or approximately of their identical twin
 brothers were also found to be homosexual as compared to only or approximately
 of the non identical twins of homosexual males and or approximately 
 of the adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of
 genetics Strangely enough the study also included pairs of biological brothers that
 were not twins and out of the homosexual males studied only or about 
 had homosexual brothers which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of
 homosexuality in the general population Bailey Pillard 
 More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a  choice 
 but rather a feeling that one is born with As one grows older they become aware of
 sexual feelings towards other persons The only difference between homosexuals and
 heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite
 sex homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex Therefore neither
 homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a  choice in the matter and asking a
 homosexual  Why are you attracted to other members of your sex is likened to asking
 a heterosexual  Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex  After all why
 would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle  As a homosexual one risks horrifying
 their parents other family members and friends to the point of losing all contact
 with them ruining their career being condemned by their religion being beat up for
 publicly displaying their sexuality and much much more Rather the only actual
 choice is whether or not to be open with ones sexuality and sexual preference 
 whether to act on ones sexual desires whether to tell others about such feelings 
 or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions Marcus
 
 To supplement my findings from research I have conducted personal interviews with
 two adolescent homosexual males James Dobbens and Daniel Woods Both were asked how
 what they thought determined homosexuality nature vs nurture and why when they
 realized they were homosexual and how they knew and similar questions Both believed
 that homosexual was a result of nature rather than nurture Dobbens Woods 
 Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual 
  Theyre not like My childs going to be gay  Dobbens Dobbens believes that he
 was born homosexual When why he was a homosexual he explained  Its just the way
 you are you cant explain it I was just born that way its like asking how the
 world was made   no one really knows Dobbens He went on to explain that while his
 nurture did not impact his sexual orientation it did affect his view of it When
 discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a childs sexuality he commented
  They can bring you up to be open minded to homosexuality but they don’t bring
 you up to be a homosexual   I grew up in a place where homosexuality is accepted 
 so that’s why i’m so open about being gay I accept myself  Whether or not you
 accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual depends
 on how you’re brought up Dobbens Woods generally agreed with Dobbens and
 justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by ones nature rather than
 nurture when he commented that  theres nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to
 anything like homosexuality  Woods When asked why he was gay he explained that
 it is simply  something that I cant help  embedded in my head nothing made me do
 it Woods He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction
 between males and females only it was between males and other males He added that
  nothing happened to make me homosexual its always been there i’ve always been
 attracted to guys Woods What I find to be extraordinary about Woods case is that
 he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys he is
 romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend
 and to be close with other females etc  but never in a sexual sense Though he has
  always kind of fantasized about getting married to a female  these feelings come
 from his  romantic side which is different from the sexual side Woods He says
 that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust maybe he could work
 it out He then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic 
  Its like race Its all something you cant help it all comes to you  Its
 internal you cant help it Woods When asked if he thought homosexuality was
 caused by a gene he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct He
 gave the example of birds which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build
 a next or catch their prey Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something
 in the development of the embryo All in all Woods views homosexuality as
  fascinating  His final thought  I also believe everyone has at least one
 homosexual attraction Its not black and white homosexual vs heterosexual its a
 spectrum Woods 
 Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics According to
 Darwins theory of natural selection the advantageous traits are passed on while
 the disadvantageous ones eventually die out For instance heterosexual males have an
 average of five times as many children as homosexual ones as a female is required to
 reproduce children yet homosexuals are by definition not sexually attracted to
 females Therefore from the evolutionary standpoint homosexuality becomes one of
 the disadvantageous traits Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five
 times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool if homosexuality was
 indeed caused by a gene it would have died out entirely by now or at least been
 reduced immensely in the number of occurrences Since neither of these events have
 yet taken place it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene
 Fulkerson 
 My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no
 definitive answer on what causes homosexuality No one knows for sure now although
 many think they do and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth Nonetheless 
 I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of
 genetic and environmental causes Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition
 towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations However this
 does not necessarily determine a homosexual rather this predisposition must be
 triggered by environmental factors This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their
 study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same
 genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality this was not the case of
 the time This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now but even as I write
 this new studies are being done Perhaps the truth is right around the corner

 Madame White Snake East Asian Femme Fatale of Old
 The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake the snake demon that takes human form and
 becomes the wife of a man has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales
 and fiction for centuries Two quintessential novellas  The Lust of the White
 Serpant from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and  Eternal
 Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda a traditional Chinese story are both relatively
 complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a
 more believable human but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal 
 While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of
 this femme fatale the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme
 fatales transgressive behavior not her eventual punishment for it 
 Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty and
 initially her portrayal was fairly direct as a villainous demon who drains the life
 force out of her human husband 
 Lai Whalen  From Folklore to Literate Theater Unpacking  Madame White
 Snake    Asian Folklore Studies no 
 But over time characterizations of her became more complex and the persona
 of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic and perhaps even a model of the ideal
 Confucian wife particularly in  Pagoda Whalen Lai notes  She was a loving wife a
 caring mother rescuer of her family from the first flood and at that point a
 general benefactor of man She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female 
 particularly forbearance 
 Ibid 
 But if she were really an ideal wife why could she not live happily with her
 human mate  Her dangerous sexuality is the key 
 Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre modern
 Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian
 wife since it is primarily associated with film characters particularly those of
 the film noir genre But this term which is relatively speaking a neologism The

 is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her
 incarnations It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive and lures men to
 their downfall with her sexual attractiveness In both incarnations of Madame White
 snake the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful Toyoo her human lover in
  Lust of the White Serpant cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and
 dreams of her and finds himself  disturbed and agitated by her  ethereal
 beauty

 In  Eternal Prisoner  Madame White Snakes bewitching beauty follows her
 lover Hsü into his dreams and the next morning  he was so distracted that he could
 not concentrate on doing business 
  Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda  Trans Diana Yu in Y W Ma
 and Joseph S M Lau Traditional Chinese Stories Themes and Variations 
 Boston Zheng Zui Co 
 Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty suggesting
 that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction 
 In addition to distracting sexuality the irregular characterization of Madame White
 Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir
 femme fatale In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective 
 Christine Gledhill writes  Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman
 is honest or a deceiver but the heroines characterisation is itself fractured so
 that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the femme fatale 
 stereotype or not 
 Christine Gledhill  Klute A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism 
 in Feminism and Film ed E Ann Kaplan New York Oxford University Press 
 
 While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently
 within their narratives the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the
 evolution of her character over time readers may not be sure whether she is a pure
 villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society because
 there is evidence of both throughout her legend She is a loyal wife to her husband
 as she has promised but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and
 deceives him about her supernatural nature 
 The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent
 of these stories A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame
 White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man 
 and she must be defeated and punished by society This is quite similar to the
 expected end for the femme fatal character in films   she is punished in some way so
 that social order and proper gender roles are restored In both stories Madame White
 Snakes secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her and she is eventually
 rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda Her husband becomes a monk and this
 further implicates Lady White Snake this time from a Buddhist perspective Female
 beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them
 from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana Furthermore Lady White Snakes
 lover is far from the ideal man He is weak willed and not particularly useful In
  Lust  the priest informs Toyoo  Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks
 and tempted you But you yourself owing to a lack of courage and spirit fell
 victim to their temporary form 
 Ugetsu Monogatari   
 The implications of this are that a stronger more capable man would not
 fall for the Ladys trickery But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere 
 If they were Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil
 character 
 Instead both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy
 for her despite her depraved sexuality Certainly readers admire her patience and
 loyalty  I searched everywhere and now that at last i’ve found you i’m very
 happy 
 Ibid 
 she gushes to him in  Lust  Readers must also acknowledge that her human
 lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her She pleads with him  We
 have a love bond between us as constant as the Tai Mountains and the Eastern Sea 
 and we must live and die together Please since we are already married take me
 back and let’s stay together the rest of our lives would’nt  that be
 wonderful 
  Eternal Prisoner  
 In another traditional vernacular story  Tsu Shih Niang Sinks the Jewel Box
 in Anger 
  Tu Shih Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger  trans Richard M W Ho in Y W 
 Ma and Joseph S M Lau Traditional Chinese Stories Themes and Variations 
 Boston Zheng Zui Co 
  the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover and
 suffers for it suggesting that traditionally loyalty and keeping ones word was
 valued on the mans part as well as a womans So her husbands failure to follow
 through on his end of the bargain completely forgetting the love he once had for
 her makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snakes plight 
 However no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers the
 story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda These stories draw from the long
 tradition of supernatural and ghost stories which usually end with the demon
 destroyed or at least subdued In the initial versions of this story Madame White
 Snake harmed her human lover so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or
 later a Buddhist monk
 Lai 
 would have been a satisfying ending Readers of early versions of the story
 might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty and
 would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her
 crushing defeat Conversely the authors of the two stories examined here do not give
 readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake so the pleasure of
 the narrative   to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory   comes not from the
 death of the insubordinate disruptive force from watching the transgressions
 themselves 
 In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir Janey Place argues that the
 strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly
 imparted by their morals at the end She writes  the final lesson of the myth
 often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic strong 
 unrepressed if destructive woman 
 Janey Place  Women in Film Noir in Women in Film Noir ed E Ann Kaplan
 London British Film Institute 
 In these two stories the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on
 in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda but the
 sexy aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover 
 This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints since it
 is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these
 stories However consciously or unconsciously these authors created a female
 character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine In fact Communists in
 the PRC in the s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against
 the patriarchy 
 Lai 
 Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine
 in her own right rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist so too
 Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly
 outside the bounds of conventional social expectations 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 The Decline of the Northeastern Ohio Steel Market Why Did Attempts by Union Leaders and Concerned Citizens to Revive the Steel Industry Ultimately Fail

 September is a date that few people in Youngstown Ohio will ever forget On that date Jennings
 Lambeth president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company announced that most of the steel companys Campbell
 Works would close Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback for the people
 of Youngstown and the surrounding area it meant disaster Mahoning County was a one industry area and the
 people of Youngstown Struthers Campbell Boardman Township and the numerous other small towns and
 villages in the area only had one main employer the steel mills 
 The events that would follow this
 date known as Black Monday are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage
 and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope Rather than sit back and wait for their
 jobs to be snatched away the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able
 to keep the factories open Petitions protests rallies collectivization and even the takeover of a steel
 companys headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the
 only source of employment that this town had These well intentioned efforts ultimately failed leaving
 thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind 
 But why did the
 brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail  When
 examining the areas history culture and economic situation we can identify four main reasons the refusal
 of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their unions Youngstown
 branch the lagging international steel market the lack of a clear organized vision for individual
 initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between
 different small towns in the region all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union
 leaders to save the industry Most importantly the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem Although
 it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions the local people simply
 could not solve a national crisis on a local level 
 
 A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio

In James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as
Poland Township Their blast furnace  Hopewell  was the very first blast furnace in the area During the Civil War 
Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products Youngstown also was a major railway
crossroads due to its strategic position between Cleveland Pittsburgh New York and Chicago In fact  More rail
cars passed under the Center Street Bridge a major bridge in Youngstown per day than any other location in the
country 

During the th century the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast
 Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast including the Mahoning
Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky By Youngstowns population had grown to nearly 
which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty year period The town continued to prosper driven by the flux of
immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills This prosperity continued until the late s when
the Great Depression hit the area hard Despite the Congress of Industrial Organizations successful efforts to
establish a national steel workers union the industry barely survived the Depression years Finally the outbreak of
the Second World War made iron and steel important again and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill
into a fast paced period of booming growth 

Youngstown may have been an important and prosperous region in the post war period but the seeds for its downfall
were slowly being sown Strikes racked the town during the forties fifties and sixties and they were often long and
bloody In the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed This prohibited strikes and lockout angering
workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down At the same time stricter governmental standards for
environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel
parts and the overeager shareholders in the companies stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie 
Most importantly Youngstowns steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive Old technology was
not replaced obsolete methods were not updated and almost none of the industrys profits were being utilized to help
modernize It was a recipe for disaster that would soon explode in the faces of hundreds of thousands of workers and
their families 

Black Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry
The announcement of the closing of the mills in was the beginning of a downward spiral which would send the
entire valley into chaos and ruin Between and a total of five mills were closed and approximately 
jobs were lost countywide Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade
the powers that be to reconsider their statement However it was clear that in the words of USWA president Lloyd
McBride  If you cant make a buck you get out of the business 


The closings meant the end of Youngstowns only real industry the end of its population growth and then end of
economic progress Without the mills people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas
of the country Those that could afford to move did so those that couldnt afford to move mostly ended up on the
streets Without an industrial or a residential base commerce shrank considerably It was becoming increasingly clear
that without the industrial base provided by the mills the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town inhabited
by those too poor or hopeful to escape The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city and so they
mobilized in a variety of ways 

Attempts to Save the Mills

The very first thing that the workers could do was  to get up a petition to stop the shutdown  says Ed Mann a local
union leader and organizer The petition was circulated eventually including thousands of signatures it was then
given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington However the representatives were shunted to
the side and ignored in Washington since Youngstowns political influence had died with its industry 

The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power but they refused to support the local union
members The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure 

Next workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded
the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of
workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively Lykes ignored the letters so the Coalition turned once again
to the federal government Here too they were ignored The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills so they
could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed 
Finally following the shutdown of US Steels plant in local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel
Headquarters in Youngstown They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene then charged the
Headquarters and took it over The workers stayed there until the next day when US Steel declared that they were ready
to talk about selling the mill Immediately after the workers left the building US steel representatives told the local
union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the
mill 

All these efforts eventually came to nothing and Youngstowns steel mills remained closed These attempts to save
the mills were hindered by several major factors including the decline of the world steel market which made American
steel impossible to sell or export 

The Decline of the World Market
The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up During
World War II the rest of the world was hungry for Americas iron and steel products however by the seventies no
foreign nations needed to import steel in such large quantities In fact American steel imports were beginning to
outweigh exports 

Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make and was often of higher quality than domestic steel Foreign
steel companies invested in their factories updating their technology and replacing their equipment often This meant
that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America and therefore were able to export a
more competitive product 

Foreign steel was also much cheaper Wage hikes although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers
in the US made American steel far more expensive Also international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap
labor Jobs were scarce in other steel exporting countries and labor laws were either non existent or allowed employers
to pay much less for work Labor costs in America continued to go up draining US companies of their resources while
companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities 

On a worldwide scale newer materials such as aluminum plastic and composites were beginning to substitute steel
both at home and abroad Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline and it affected both domestic and foreign
companies However to American companies already suffering financial setbacks outdated machinery and fierce
competition this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford Americas steel remained unsold flooding
the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy 

Since this problem was a national one rather than a local one the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were
not unique Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry but it was not
alone The problem was a national one involving many more mills and issues than Youngstowns alone J Philip Richley 
a union member and organizer of many attempts to save the mills has summed it up thus  You just cant solve a
nation wide problem in a single city  The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the
entire steel community in America Trying to prop up one citys mills was impossible when faced with the depression that
spread throughout the entire industry 

The Save Our Valley Campaign Lack of Funds and Plans
Eventually some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and
former steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign As the name suggests local leaders wanted to
instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency driving them forward to confront steel companies and
owners and help secure the future of the region Marches speeches and letter writing were all employed to help
stimulate the Campaign and rally the people 
But the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding The people of Youngstown being now
unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive College tuition clothes food and heating all
had to come before donations to non profit organizations People outside of the area had no personal investment in the
mills and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds The lack of money proved
to be crippling because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively Without
funds the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the citys dying economy 

The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component an actual concrete plan No one seemed to know
just how to go about fixing the problems Letters and petitions were all very well but they did little to improve the
situation People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization but no one could really fathom exactly how that would
work the people of Youngstown were after all not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general 
Beyond that no one knew how they should proceed everyone knew that saving the mills was important but nobody stepped
forward with a full fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down 
Without a real plan nothing could truly be achieved 

Without funds to drive the efforts or even a real plan of action the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than
good In effect it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything People became excited
and waited for the mills to reappear but they never did The Campaign failed to save any jobs and Youngstown was
plunged into economic chaos 

The Apathy of USWA

United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit 
Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs However it
soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight the international branch was not The
higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight attempting to shut out the
appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening 

Actually one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do No one
had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before and none of the leaders of USWA not even president Lynn
Williams knew what could be done It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings
would be one of the worst in US history and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered Rather
than try and come up with some sort of scenario the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown hoping that
perhaps the problem would resolve itself or at least not spread any further than it already had 

Besides incompetence the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart fear of socialism 
Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action but they worried that the federal government might see
the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism If the
USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories then the
government and potentially other important people and institutions as well might begin to think that the UWSA leaders
were encouraging socialism This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its
people something they could not afford to do Therefore they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch
fight it out alone 

Regionalism

From its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets Youngstown is the
name of the major city area but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are
indistinguishable from the main city itself Boardman Poland Township Struthers Lowellville Warren Lordstown 
Canfield Niles and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown see Figure People from each town
work shop eat and socialize in towns separate from their own making each town strongly dependent on every other
town However although traffic is heavy between each separate district each area has its own distinct cultural
ethnicity educational system heritage history and even food For example Struthers is a poor town with a large
Slovak population where education is generally better than in surrounding towns but unemployment is much higher and
pollution is widespread Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist Two blocks over one finds Boardman a
well off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman
Catholic with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding
towns and the streets are clean and well kept With many more cultures religions and economic levels living in close
proximity to one another a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area regionalism Each town with their own identity 
instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations which dictates many habits exchanges and
interactions between populations Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred with certain
towns becoming sworn enemies of others 

With so much regional tension it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause even one that would
save their jobs and their futures Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from
Campbell and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman even if they were supposed to be
working towards the same thing A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement because no one was
willing to put aside regional differences to work together In some instances small companies would express interest in
helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area but because of regional pride no one could ever agree
where the new businesses should relocate In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for
new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional
pride 

Conclusion The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday
 
Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact
were unsuccessful for four main reasons the failure of the international steel market the lack of funds and plans in
initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of
ineptitude and fear and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope
for brining in new companies 

What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level and perhaps it
is not But to the thousands of people living there the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves
through their economic political and social futures Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence hundreds of
people were uprooted forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities Hundreds more joined the unemployment
lines or even began living on the streets For the people of Youngstown Black Monday was not just a historical event 
it was the most important event in their lives 


The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves something
which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on Even though they eventually failed the fact that they
tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives
and the futures of their children

If middle school was a kingdom then Priscilla would surely be the queen She was tall graceful pretty and interacted well with people She wore stylish trendy clothes and was the one that people strived to please Priscilla was adored by the teachers and she knew how to get what she wanted Though she acted kindly and refrained from malicious acts of meaness most of the time she still had a slice of vanity in her essence She didn’t quite fancy the idea of spending time with anyone deemed unpopular or stupid Occasionally she would volunteer her time for charity but she didn’t work the hardest Yet whenever she did even the slightest good deed a newspaper reporter always happened to be around Despite the fact that she was deemed an intelligent beauty by many and as much as she was one the amazing truth still stood As much as it appeared she wasn’t the greatest or the purest prettiest or bravest There was another who was all of this and so much more Someday all would see this

Contoured metallic parts glided and folded out over me emerging from the wall and pushing me back in with them The androids face was lost as I was suddenly plunged into darkness 
I screamed I screamed for all I was worth claustrophobia rampaging in my stomach like a terrified bull My arms and legs vibrated struggling like crazy to get free 
A voice genderless and robotic suddenly filled my head  Do nOt mO ove Ana LYzing i in THREE  e TWO  oo WUH  un  A sharp blade of light blinded me for a split second then moved down the rest of my body I could see I was totally encased in metal Claustrophobia started welling up again 
The bar of blue light retracted into the front of my shell and with a sudden lurch the pod hurtled upward I was being shot to the top of the building racing through its walls It was all one gigantic machine 
Suddenly it stopped and I had the sense I was very very high up

 One twist is all it will take so tell me whats it gonna be   Cesar said  Tell your old pal Cesar where your old man is or its curtains for Kitty  
The girls cried Their mother looked with contempt upon the loathsome slime bag holding their kitten 
The kitten would have to die before she would tell him where her husband was hiding 
He would threaten the girls next she knew 
 Lady your hubby saw me kill that last girl in the park I watched him as he held her hand as she died I know he saw me He can identify me lady I simply cannot allow that to happen I will snap your daughters necks like little twigs   Casar said as he broke the neck of the kitten it whimpered softly and went slack in his calloused hands 
He picked up the youngest child by the scruff of her neck and said   Now tell me where he is

happiness continues to feed mine as we rebuild our lives I don’t think he knows just how much he’s changed me All he
ever talks about is how i’ve changed him Sometimes I admit I wish we had that vibrant sort of romance my new college
friends rave about having But then I don’t I love Drew I know that and i’ve always known that ever since I found him

way to make huge public displays of it Actually a few of our friends don’t even know were dating But none of this

 What are you doing   he asked more confused than ever 
 Rocking out  I answered slowly not sure what else to call it 
The android folded his arms utterly stumped  One minute you jumble numbers incoherently but the next you send vocal impulses in a coherent pattern in a manner you call rocking out  He shook his head  And yet you still function normally

Wrinkles formed in Zeuss hearty face as he agreed to Eross proposal  Your mother wont like it  he laughed  but she certainly cant say no to this  Eros pushed a very shaky Psyche up to Zeus who promptly laid his hands on her shoulders  I King of the Gods grant you Psyche the mortal the greatest gift a god can give a mortal Go now knowing you will live for eternity  Immediatley Psyches form began to shimmer and Eros ran up to her enfolding her in his arms and wings Right in the nick of time Aphrodite burst into the room  Get off her my son  she shrieked  You have no right touching a mortal  Eros looked up at his enraged mother  But that is where you are wrong She is not mortal   she is immortal she is my wife and we will get married the proper way  Aphrodite turned incredulously to Zeus for consolation but he nodded his head  It is true  he replied  You cannot argue to the marraige of a god to a goddess  Defeated Aphrodite sat down and the happy lovers celebrated

He was staring at me so intently I smiled again nervously And i’m not supposed to be the nervous one I started babbling about the school and blahblahblah but he continued to stare with the cute little glimmer in his eyes How sweet 
Its a bit obvious that he likes me now but that’s okay Itll only not be okay when Emmett comes back into the picture I pushed the thoughts of my football player away and focused on the words coming out of my mouth 
Too bad we reached the Algebra classroom quickly He opened the door for me and I strolled up to the teacher  Ah Anna Hello What a pleasure    The Cood said to me with a fake smile 
I motioned to Cameron and said  Youve got a new student Now if youll excuse me I must get to class    I told her in my sweetest voice and her smile got wider like she was talking to a fucking angel or something Whatever I winked at Cameron before heading to my Geometry class a level up Naw I shouldnt tell him He might feel stupid Stupid and cute though

Of course I want to make out with you Why do you even bother asking  Of course all I want to do is feel your arms wrapped around me But it just cant happen today Not today maybe not tomorrow maybe not ever 
Why you ask  Maybe because I value your life Maybe because I don’t want to be the reason why my father has to tear you to shreds That could be it The bigger question is why do you keep asking why  You know the answer It doesn’t change 
No i’m not going with your crazy plan Its crazy and going to get us both killed Plus only a monkey would fall for  President elect Obama has ordered me to stay home today so you’re just going to have to leave me home alone No i’m not sneaking a guy over that’s crazy  You must really think my parents are stupid Stupid crazy or maybe both 
Please don’t make this harder than what it is Please don’t make me feel any guiltier about not being able to be with you Its not fair Especially since your the one who doesn’t have time to make it official

In one of the happiest stories in Greek mythology Love Eros and Soul Psyche were finally united The story of Eros and Psyche is said to be the first fairy tell ever written and most definetly the sweetest Nothing can seperate the two not even the tempermental envious goddess of Love 
Some say the reason Eros is not in many myths was because Psyche kept him home all the time   he went from being mischevious and abusing of his power to a well loved man god  with a wife Others say Psyche never was granted immortality and died in Eross arms causing him immense and lasting sadness but what kind of a story is that

He was leading me in a different direction I had no idea where 
The woman was there too running next to us 
It was all in a daze 
It was as if I couldnt focus couldnt seem to actually pay attention to my surroundings I saw things but couldnt react I tripped over a log Grant and the woman had easily jumped over I was scratched by thornbushes theyd dodged 
I saw the dogs but didn’t say anything 
They were running alongside us trying to attack I wanted to say something was urging to scream out with all my will but for some reason nothing came out 
This really was like a movie just like me watching another version of everything around me while the real me was in a parallel episode just watching the other one 
It was a little weird The me in both scenes was screaming at the other me to say something to warn them 
Confusing 
We ran out into the road after Grant noticed them too In plain sight 
We werent hidden anymore

 Run cant you HEAR me   
 You wont do it    he said affectionately  You cant do it   
My mind took this as a challenge something I had to prove wrong  Get out of here    My voice took on the monotonous tone it always does when i’m about to use my ability 
 Regan   he put his hand on my shoulder  Calm down   
Why did he act so understanding  He didn’t know ANYTHING yet he was still trying to  ˜comfort me I just wanted to be left alone

The bowl of popcorn was settled between them rather awkwardly at best Both Chloe and Alex decided to fully immerse themselves in the film on the screen to try and deny themselves the truth in what had happened just minutes ago 
For   of an hour they were sucessful Each one pretended that the other was only a figment of their imagination Until the moment they both reached into the bowl and found not only popcorn kernels but the cool touch of the others skin Alexs fingers lingered in the bowl while Chloe quickly withdrew her hand From that point on neither friend could focus on the movie As though suddenly inspired Alex grabbed the bowl and placed it on the table with a sheepish grin 
 That was bothering me  he told Chloe honestly Chloe attempted to muffle a laugh 
 What  Alex asked worriedly  Whats funny 
 It was bothering me too  she burst 
Alex chortled nervously Chloe snorted Before they realized it they were holding each other laughing until tears escaped their eyes

The blood 
The blood had always been the problem or rather the washing away the blood Now after finding the cave there were no problems Now it was time to kill a human 
My first choice was a nine year old girl Alisha was her name She was in my ninth grade class She had red hair freckles and no close friends I followed her home for two weeks just getting to know the route and her neighborhood 
I picked the ideal spot a full block under construction And during the winter months the workmen were gone when school let out 
She was easy to get All I did was call out her name and she walked over to me One quick glance around and I struck her with a piece of iron pipe I dragged her over to a ditch and covered her with a piece of scrap plywood 
After dark I carried her to the cave The cave was the home of hundreds of rats I laid her out on the ground stripped her and cut open both of her legs that was to draw the rats Three days later I went back and there was nothing left

The helicopters were coming our way I heard them coming nearer 
 Come on over here  the woman screamed sliding down the face of the cliff 
I followed and without thinking jumped down as well 
Landing with a loud thump onto a dusty road leading into even more woods I followed the woman who wasn’t taking the path 
 Where are you going  I asked once I caught up with her 
 Theres a river in this direction Theres dogs Think about it 
The dogs obviously did catch a scent and it was true The only way to lose them would be by either crossing the river or just swimming downstream 
How did she know this landscape  How had she known there was a river there 
I didn’t ask her soon I heard the soft splashing sounds of the water and jumped 
I looked behind me all around me The water was only five six feet right here We could easily hide if the helicopters came near It would be easier now We could all get out of here

As I worked my jaw I blinked my eyes trying to adjust to the brightness of the floodlamps behind that illuminated the room before me My captors loomed behind the lights anonymous and threatening 
Before me was a mirror set into the wall next to a heavy metal door Rust pitted the floor walls and ceiling alike Crusty bolt heads dotted the exposed surfaces at regular intervals On the diamond plate floor in front of me was the cloth that had been used as my gag The blood had long since darkened to brown but I still recognized it as her scarf 
I started to twist my neck around anxious to glimpse the figures behind when suddenly the lights were extinguished and my room fell into darkness 
Except for the dull glow of the mirror in front of me which now manifested as a window backlit from the other side

Were raised to believe that we will die before our children do Its only natural we grow old and die and they carry on after us that’s not supposed to change 
As a father I always wondered if I was good enough I wanted to raise Andrew to be a stand up man a good friend somebodys husband I thought he was on his way but I was blind 
In all honesty I probably wasn’t around as much as I should have been I should have talked to my boy I should have asked him how he felt He was so young and I never even considered that he might be so alone 
I made mistakes  Andrews mother will be the first to tell you that But believe me when I say i’ve paid for them with the one thing that mattered the most If youll excuse me now

So I sat and listened to the dull whir of everyones bored thoughts Bored bored bored was basically all I heard 
Then I felt something on my head like crumbs What  I brushed my head off to see white crumbs land on my desk Then more fell from the ceiling I looked up 
The crumbs were coming from the ceiling tiles  What  I murmured 
 Bree Pay attention in class for once  Miss Widler yelled Everyone stared at me I blinked and stated  Yes Miss Widler but the the ceiling its snowing 
Everyone looked up at that moment but of course the ceiling stopped by that time  Stop distracting everyone Bree Youve just wasted a good minutes of learning So 
Were all of the teachers out to get me here or something  They never listen to me

I like games 
I started playing my games because of people like Jenna Middle school was cruel full of disgusting stinking children Hardly a place for the likes of me but nobody ever did a thing about it 
The thing that set me off at first was her hair it was long and shiny and blonde Every time somebody spoke to her she tossed it over her shoulder rivers of gold streaming down her back Practically taunting me and my scissors After a few weeks of the friendly game I was no longer  weird So when I invited her over to play a game with me nobody suspected a thing 
I recall how she cried when I chopped it all off with messy rough snips I remember her straw hair wound tightly around her neck I didn’t need any rope Tipping over the chair and putting a match to the boyish mess that was the rest of her hair beauty The meadow on fire 
Want to play a game with me  There are only a few rules First you must play along Second don’t try to escape Oh and third I always win

It took me such a long time but everything has finally fallen into place The memories I had of him were all memories of when we were going out when I thought I was in love All I had now were memories There was just one thing Every memory I had only caused me pain to think about Simple solution right  Just don’t think about it But How could you not think about it if it was what made you happy  If it was the best few months of your life would’nt  you want to remember Oh and what sucked the most  The ring he gave me for my last birthday Unhealthily attatched to it Sure I tried to take it off I went a good three seconds before hyperventilating and putting it back on my finger I needed to move on I needed to just forget him because I was dying inside There was just one problem I needed him to breath Without him I felt so wrong Every memory that once made me smile now caused the pain in my chest I needed to move on This was surely not healthy for me Or for anyone

I reached the top and clapped my feet on the ground to stop my momentum The wind was blowing hard I suddenly regretted not getting a haircut when my mom told me to What am I trying to prove anyway  My mind flinched back against this remark I swung my legs over the seat and let the bike fall to the ground Standing there silently I was forced to reflect on that very question 
What are you trying to prove  Or rather disprove 
My name 
Why 
Im just a normal guy I don’t want to be famous 
What are you hiding from  Why are you afraid

Seth rushed over but as he leaned over her something hit him in the back of the head He turned around and grabbed it A respirator Seth hesitated but decided there was nothing else to do 
Abbeys breath calmed as the cone molded to her mouth and she settled down to a comfortable peace Seth thought he could use some of that right about now Or Calvin still crying by the foyer stairs

Music Yes music I played a song in my head one that Id heard on the radio 
Focusing all of my concentration on the song I started singing and humming parts of it aloud Somewhere faraway Karon was saying something to me but didn’t listen attention to any of it 
It probably looked a little funny me lying there humming him trying to talk to me After only a minute or two of it I stopped 
I heard scrawling on a notebook and he said  Interesting You really are interesting Regan   
He said this with a sort of astonishment as if by me singing Id prevented something previously unpreventable 
Hed had to have been planning this ¦ had to have known I would have reacted the way I did 
Not many people could control their thoughts unless something were at stake and even then many people couldnt Nothing was at stake for them Their minds were a refuge a retreat

I was asleep before I could answer

At the top of the hill I veered south I really didn’t want to return home and face Adelle 
I had never been to this part before and so I had no clue what awaited me I would soon find out 
Fields Miles and miles of them which seemed to stretch on for much longer than that My throat tightened at the scene This was like my dream 
Shivering and not from the cold I walked my bike through the tall grasses not quite sure where I was headed To be honest I didn’t really care And that scared me I was programmed to be scared It was in my nature What was this some kind of outburst of mechanical difficulties 
Ahhh 
The wind blew smoothly over my face as I dropped my bike to the ground and lifted my face to the pure white clouds above me 
This is what living was Not any of that Gianna nonsense This is what everyone was meant for Just to live 
I smiled I had entered another world One where there wasn’t any choosing wasn’t any Giannas and there most definitely wasn’t any fame

 Why do you want me to go with you so badly

I still didn’t see how what hed said answered my question or not but I followed him as he walked down to his room 
Music was booming from somewhere Id heard it before wed even opened the door The sound was loud but didn’t muffle out everything else Somebody was sitting in the room beating his hands against a book to the rhythm of the song 
Theo ignoring his roommate pulled me over to the beds against the side of the wall I sat down on it and curled up against his pillow listening to the song Finally some relaxation

 Oh Well I am So ¦ you can stay here I guess    I heard him shuffle out of the room followed by his roommate 
Pretty soon after theyd gone someone else entered  How was your nap   
Him again 
 Please leave me alone   
 Just here to take some tests   Doctor Karon pulled something out of his pocket and turned it on with a click  Sit up face me   
He pointed the little flashlight at least that’s what I thought it was into both of my eyes then checked my ears He jotted down something on his paper and pulled another instrument out of his pocket

I woke up in Spencers arms He smiled down at me sweetly but I gaped in horror His nose was bleeding and his eye looked like it was minutes from serious bruising Yet he was smiling 
 What  ¦ what happened    I whispered to him and his smiled widened 
 Its so great to hear your voice I saw you in Roberts car and so I came to the rescue You went out a couple minutes in and I was so afraid that you werent coming back He ran off about thirty minutes ago and now its just us   
I finally cracked a smile  Us is just how I like it   
Despite his destroyed face he leaned down and kissed me gently  Its all going to be okay Grace Its all going to be okay    He repeated and maybe he was trying to convince both of us Sooner or later he’s going to get tired of rescuing me from Robert and then  ¦ well I just don’t know 
For now though i’m content right here in his arms far away from Robert

Having an amazing time was no problem considering the fact that Jared and I had a lot in common I went online and first checked if my favorite ficlet author wrote a sequel to his story I read and commented it then checked my Myspace and had a ton of new friend requests from people in school I accepted them all and organized them on my top Jared was online and I decided to check his profile and saw that I was already on his top his first I didn’t think it was a big deal so I ignored it leaving him where he was on mine He later messaged me asking if I had fun and all that day I answered him laughing in delight when he suddenly replied  Hey why arent i first on your top  Well i did have other friends I thought Plus I just met him right  He was the one putting me on his top so quickly so I didn’t answer baffled by what to say He messaged me again asking to hang out with me again I denied the request because i was already invited by other people He messaged back seeming mad

 Ow  I jumped as a circuit in my arm sparked  Ah hell  I muttered sparing only a glance for my robotic arm  You win some you lose some 
I stood there for a moment deciding where I was gonna go Staring out at the open fields I realized it was possible to be free Free from authority free from pestering humans who had too many questions and too much hate and most of all free from Gianna 
The wind insisted on punching me in the face so I punched it back screaming  Hoooo yeeeaaaaaahh  I leaped in the air and landed on my feet grinning Suddenly I was ecstatic I couldnt hold it in 
 Yeeeee hoooooo  I cried jubilantly running and jumping I grabbed my bike and ran next to it whooping and hollering Finally I jumped up and straddled the seat mid run My super fast reflexes could do that 
I peddled fast and fast and fast And I was flying Almost I didn’t know where I was going but I was moving forward That much was for sure

She could tell they were armed by the way their clothes moved over places like their ankles or their chests Melody was not only gifted with various talents such as stealth the ability to move silently invisibly and extremely quickly but she was very observant She climbed down from the tree using her stealth power to get next to the boy running into step with him He looked over at her surprised 
 Whats going on    She asked him matching his pace easily 
 What the  How     The boy exclaimed amazed that she could keep up

 How should I know     The boy replied  I was just walking through town when those two showed up and grabbed me I ran for it and theyve been following me since then    he explained 
 Well why don’t we give them a slip    she asked winking at him 
 Sounds good to me   He replied 
They both disappeared veering invisibly off to the left The two men came to a halt not knowing where the youths had gone Melody and the boy could still see each other in a sort of mirror world of the regular one The mirror world was much slower than the real world which is why they moved so much faster when cloaked by their abilities Walking would appear as running when traveling in the mirror realm that is if anyone in the real world was able to see them Melody stopped as did the boy  So who are you

 I think its safe to back there   She called over to Owen who was still standing where they had stopped 
 Right    Owen said disappearing and reappearing in the real world Melody did the same and walked over to Owen now at regular speed 
 So you ok    she asked politely He looked fine 
 Yeah they never caught me    he replied nonetheless a little shook up He took a deep breath and looked at her  So you have the gift of stealth too    he said tentatively 
 Gift of stealth ¦    Melody asked

After a moment he agreed  Yeah thatd be great It would probably be safer if we traveled in stealth though There might be more of those guys    he suggested looking around warily 
 Yeah you’re probably right let’s go its not far    Melody said and the two returned to the mirror realm again setting off for her apartment 
They reached the Hotel building but instead stepped into the side alley to reappear They didn’t want to cause a scene by just popping up out of thin air in the middle of the city They appeared behind a dumpster and stepped out into the street and then inside Montier Hotel greeting the warmth happily

It crashed loudly into the branches of the leafless apple tree splintering wood and screaming aloud It sounded like a hawks cry it did I ran towards it It was an angel An angel cast down from the heavens and fallen to the earth Its big brown wings were twisted and it was horribly cut from where it crashed into the tree and yet its crashing into the tree very well might have saved its life for the tree slowed its fall enough so that when it fell out of the tree it was not hurt as badly as it would have been if it had landed on the cold hard ground first I ran up to it filled first with excitement and then with concern It was moaning and occasionally it uttered a lamenting phrase in some incomprehensible language and tears ran down its face I saw that instead of a normal nose and mouth it had a curved birds beak of the sort that eagles have I knelt beside it not sure if I should move it inside or if moving it might just injure it more

Todd is also looking around but he cant see anything but a ball point pen that’s been crushed Probably from when Tom fell out of the tree he thinks sour faced God I hope that kid is hurting Serves him right

Without even looking at him Todd answers  No i’m fine You can go now

 Oh Harper shut up already you’re a size two  I stretched out over my bed twirling a dark lock of hair on my finger 
Harper shut up It was only expected 
Gia came in with a bag of popcorn and another bag of Swedish Fish followed closely behind by Emilie who was carrying five sodas 
 Here we go luvs  Emilie plopped the sodas down on the bedside table 
 Wheres Demi  Gia looked around the room her eyes focusing on me 
 Not quite sure  I tugged at my tank top  She should be here soon 
 Hello girls

 Oh sorry guys I got here as soon as I could  Demis hair was wind blown and her nose was pink

Tom cant run any longer 
He falls exhausted to the ground and the sound of the snow crunching beneath his body fills his frozen ears He gasps as the cold seeps through his clothes He cant stop his teeth from chattering hopelessly and his shoulders begin to shake as well 
 Oooooo  he groans shifting on the cold ground  Noooo  His attempted moan escapes as only a whisper He can hear the sound of nearby cars driving by and he lifts an arm uselessly  Help  he croaks quietly 
His leg aches terribly It feels as though a knife is piercing through his skin and his muscles and oh The pain is unbearable His ears are ringing 
Tom pulls off his gloves and stares at his red hands in shock Weakly he begins to rub them together to stimulate some heat but he is unsuccessful As a last desperate hope he shoves his hands under his armpits He is finally greeted by a sliver of warmth and he shivers in relief 
But it wont be enough if he is left alone too much longer

My heart skipped a beat in horror What was he doing here  Pure coincidence could be an explanation and it sounded like a good one so I went with that and waved at him He smiled I looked away and saw from the corner of my eyes he was angry 
A few weeks had passed since I came to Marzark Jared and I hung out almost everyday and he was making me popular One Friday Jared had to visit his family in a different part of town and for once I had nothing to do I picked up my phone and looked at my recent call list to see if anyone would hang out today All incoming calls from Jared A few outgoing to Jared I looked through my contact list and called Jueli She wasn’t busy either and she invited me to the mall I gladly accepted I swiftly put on my clothes and was out the door in less than a few minutes I waited until Jueli came to leave I stopped abruptly noticing a vibration coming from my leg It was a text from Jared  im comin home now so we can hang out

He awakens in water Warm water Someone is rubbing his arms with soapy hands  Wha   he murmurs The light is bright Suddenly the lights dim and he is able to fully open his eyes 
Tom is astonished to find himself sitting in a white porcelain bathtub He suddenly realizes something is touching his leg No Not just his leg but his back as well All at once the realization comes and then he hears a voice speak into his ear from behind

His instinct makes him stiffen at the touch of a girl but immediately he relaxes as she reaches around him and begins to massage his adolescent hairless chest She moves up his arms and onto his shoulders murmuring softly the whole time He cant help but give up control He let’s his head loll back onto her shoulder closing his eyes and moaning in pleasure He is very aware that her breasts are pressed against his back 
Suddenly her hands are moving downward She grips him by the waist and hoists him back toward her Instinctively he moves with her and grabs her hand She squeezes it and with the other hand begins to explore his thighs and the space between 
He gasps his eyes wide open now Something in her touch has reawakened a long lost memory and he is turned on The water is soothing and he moves with her tuning into the rhythm of her moving hand his mind elsewhere in the past 
He is imagining that day long ago when that very special person did the same thing and he fell in love

A few more hours crept by one by one with nothing happening I occupied myself by pacing the tile and gazing out at the Chicago skyline then finally sitting down and listen to my stomach purr with hunger 
Finally a noise came through and broke the silence But it wasn’t a voice it was just a mechanical noise 
Suddenly the entire floor underneath me groaned and creaked tipping to a nearly forty degree angle I yelled out and skidded down the slick marble floor eyes widening as I realized the whole thing was hurtling me straight for one of the glass windows The soles of my feet nearly burned off from the friction I made trying to stop myself 
I closed my eyes and the explosion of glass reached my ears Shards ripped at my clothing hundred mile per hour winds immediately shooting me out into the opening spinning me around and around until  
Dark Light My fingers felt cold stone underneath them I opened my eyes 
Tiled marble floor lay underneath me 




 
 
 
 A Wasted Day
 Richard Harding

 
 Part One
 When its turn came the private secretary somewhat apologetically laid the
 letter in front of the Wisest Man in Wall Street 
  From Mrs Austin probation officer Court of General Sessions   he explained 
  Wants a letter about Spear he’s been convicted of theft Comes up for sentence
 Tuesday 
  Spear  repeated Arnold Thorndike 
  Young fellow stenographer used to do your letters last summer going in and out
 on the train 
 The great man nodded  I remember What about him 
 The habitual gloom of the private secretary was lightened by a grin 
  Went on the loose had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to the firm 
 he’s with Isaacs Sons now shoe people on Sixth Avenue Met a woman and
 woke up without the money The next morning he offered to make good but Isaacs
 called in a policeman When they looked into it they found the boy had been
 drunk They tried to withdraw the charge but hed been committed Now the
 probation officer is trying to get the judge to suspend sentence A letter from
 you sir would 
 It was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere Young men who drunk or
 sober spent the firms money on women who disappeared before sunrise did not
 appeal to him Another letter submitted that morning had come from his art agent
 in Europe In Florence he had discovered the Correggio he had been sent to find 
 It was undoubtedly genuine and he asked to be instructed by cable The price was
 forty thousand dollars With one eye closed and the other keenly regarding the
 inkstand Mr Thorndike decided to pay the price and with the facility of long
 practice dismissed the Correggio and snapped his mind back to the present 
  Spear had a letter from us when he left didn’t he  he asked  What he has
 developed into SINCE he left us  he shrugged his shoulders The secretary
 withdrew the letter and slipped another in its place 
  Homer Firth the landscape man  he chanted  wants permission to use blue flint
 on the new road with turf gutters and to plant silver firs each side Says it
 will run to about five thousand dollars a mile 
  No  protested the great man firmly  blue flint makes a country place look like
 a cemetery Mine looks too much like a cemetery now Landscape gardeners  he
 exclaimed impatiently  Their only idea is to insult nature The place was better
 the day I bought it when it was running wild you could pick flowers all the way
 to the gates  Pleased that it should have recurred to him the great man smiled 
  Why Spear  he exclaimed  always took in a bunch of them for his mother Dont
 you remember we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the grounds
 picking flowers  Mr Thorndike nodded briskly  I like his taking flowers to his
 mother 
  He SAID it was to his mother  suggested the secretary gloomily 
  Well he picked the flowers anyway  laughed Mr Thorndike  He didn’t pick our
 pockets And he had the run of the house in those days As far as we know  he
 dictated  he was satisfactory don’t say more than that 
 The secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil  And the landscape man 
  Tell him  commanded Thorndike  I want a wood road suitable to a farm and to
 let the trees grow where God planted them 
 As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was
 occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad the
 Japanese loan the new wing to his art gallery and an attack that morning in his
 own newspaper upon his pet trust But his busy mind was not too occupied to
 return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him Or by
 some genius of memory to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear
 was to be sentenced for theft It was a charming morning The spring was at full
 tide and the air was sweet and clean Mr Thorndike considered whimsically that
 to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding
 a year to his sentence He regretted he had not given the probation officer a
 stronger letter He remembered the young man now and favorably A shy silent
 youth deft in work and at other times conscious and embarrassed But that on
 the part of a stenographer in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street was
 not unnatural On occasions Mr Thorndike had put even royalty  frayed 
 impecunious royalty on the lookout for a loan at its ease 
 The hood of the car was down and the taste of the air warmed by the sun was
 grateful It was at this time a year before that young Spear picked the spring
 flowers to take to his mother A year from now where would young Spear be 
 It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly so quickly that his friends
 declared he was a slave to impulse It was these same impulses leading so
 invariably to success that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man He leaned
 forward and touched the chauffeurs shoulder  Stop at the Court of General
 Sessions  he commanded What he proposed to do would take but a few minutes A
 word a personal word from him to the district attorney or the judge would be
 enough He recalled that a Sunday Special had once calculated that the working
 time of Arnold Thorndike brought him in two hundred dollars a minute At that
 rate keeping Spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars 
 Out of the sunshine Mr Thorndike stepped into the gloom of an echoing rotunda 
 shut in on every side hung by balconies lit many stories overhead by a dirty
 skylight The place was damp the air acrid with the smell of stale tobacco juice 
 and foul with the presence of many unwashed humans A policeman chewing stolidly 
 nodded toward an elevator shaft and other policemen nodded him further on to the
 office of the district attorney There Arnold Thorndike breathed more freely He
 was again among his own people He could not help but appreciate the dramatic
 qualities of the situation that the richest man in Wall Street should appear in
 person to plead for a humble and weaker brother He knew he could not escape
 recognition his face was too well known but he trusted for the sake of Spear 
 the reporters would make no display of his visit With a deprecatory laugh he
 explained why he had come But the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did
 not follow 
 The district attorney ran his finger briskly down a printed card  Henry Spear 
 he exclaimed  thats your man Part Three Judge Fallon Andrews is in that
 court  He walked to the door of his private office  Andrews  he called 
 He introduced an alert broad shouldered young man of years of much indiscretion
 and with a charming and inconsequent manner 
  Mr Thorndike is interested in Henry Spear coming up for sentence in Part Three
 this morning Wants to speak for him Take him over with you 
 The district attorney shook hands quickly and retreated to his private office 
 Mr Andrews took out a cigarette and as he crossed the floor lit it 
  Come with me  he commanded Somewhat puzzled slightly annoyed but enjoying
 withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception Mr 
 Thorndike followed He decided that in his ignorance he had wasted his own time
 and that of the prosecuting attorney He should at once have sent in his card to
 the judge As he understood it Mr Andrews was now conducting him to that
 dignitary and in a moment he would be free to return to his own affairs which
 were the affairs of two continents But Mr Andrews led him to an office bare and
 small and offered him a chair and handed him a morning newspaper There were
 people waiting in the room strange people only like those Mr Thorndike had seen
 on ferry boats They leaned forward toward young Mr Andrews fawning their eyes
 wide with apprehension 
 Mr Thorndike refused the newspaper  I thought I was going to see the judge  he
 suggested 
  Court doesn’t open for a few minutes yet  said the assistant district attorney 
  Judge is always late anyway 
 Mr Thorndike suppressed an exclamation He wanted to protest but his clear mind
 showed him that there was nothing against which with reason he could protest He
 could not complain because these people were not apparently aware of the sacrifice
 he was making He had come among them to perform a kindly act He recognized that
 he must not stultify it by a show of irritation He had precipitated himself into
 a game of which he did not know the rules That was all Next time he would know
 better Next time he would send a clerk But he was not without a sense of humor 
 and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing He laughed
 good naturedly and reached for the desk telephone 
  May I use this  he asked He spoke to the Wall Street office He explained he
 would be a few minutes late He directed what should be done if the market opened
 in a certain way He gave rapid orders on many different matters asked to have
 read to him a cablegram he expected from Petersburg and one from Vienna 
  They answer each other  was his final instruction  It looks like peace 
 Mr Andrews with genial patience had remained silent Now he turned upon his
 visitors A Levantine burly unshaven and soiled towered truculently above him 
 Young Mr Andrews with his swivel chair tilted back his hands clasped behind his
 head his cigarette hanging from his lips regarded the man dispassionately 
  You gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me  he commented cheerfully To Mr 
 Thorndike the form of greeting was novel So greatly did it differ from the
 procedure of his own office that he listened with interest 
  Was it you  demanded young Andrews in a puzzled tone  or your brother who
 tried to knife me  Mr Thorndike unaccustomed to cross the pavement to his
 office unless escorted by bank messengers and plain clothes men felt the room
 growing rapidly smaller the figure of the truculent Greek loomed to heroic
 proportions The hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin and from there fell
 to his pearl pin which he hastily covered 
  Get out  said young Andrews  and don’t show your face here 
 The door slammed upon the flying Greek Young Andrews swung his swivel chair so
 that over his shoulder he could see Mr Thorndike  I don’t like his face  he
 explained 
 A kindly eyed sad woman with a basket on her knee smiled upon Andrews with the
 familiarity of an old acquaintance 
  Is that woman going to get a divorce from my son  she asked  now that he’s in
 trouble 
  Now that he’s in Sing Sing  corrected Mr Andrews  I HOPE so She deserves it 
 That son of yours Mrs Bernard  he declared emphatically  is no good 
 The brutality shocked Mr Thorndike For the woman he felt a thrill of sympathy 
 but at once saw that it was superfluous From the secure and lofty heights of
 motherhood Mrs Bernard smiled down upon the assistant district attorney as upon
 a naughty child She did not even deign a protest She continued merely to smile 
 The smile reminded Thorndike of the smile on the face of a mother in a painting by
 Murillo he had lately presented to the chapel in the college he had given to his
 native town 
  That son of yours  repeated young Andrews  is a leech he’s robbed you robbed
 his wife Best thing I ever did for YOU was to send him up the river 
 The mother smiled upon him beseechingly 
  Could you give me a pass  she said 
 Young Andrews flung up his hands and appealed to Thorndike 
  Isnt that just like a mother  he protested  That son of hers has broken her
 heart tramped on her cheated her hasnt left her a cent and she comes to me
 for a pass so she can kiss him through the bars And Ill bet she’s got a cake
 for him in that basket 
 The mother laughed happily she knew now she would get the pass 
  Mothers  explained Mr Andrews from the depth of his wisdom  are all like
 that your mother my mother If you went to jail your mother would be just like
 that 
 Mr Thorndike bowed his head politely He had never considered going to jail or
 whether if he did his mother would bring him cake in a basket Apparently there
 were many aspects and accidents of life not included in his experience 
 Young Andrews sprang to his feet and with the force of a hose flushing a gutter 
 swept his soiled visitors into the hall 
  Come on  he called to the Wisest Man  the court is open 
 In the corridors were many people and with his eyes on the broad shoulders of the
 assistant district attorney Thorndike pushed his way through them The people who
 blocked his progress were of the class unknown to him Their looks were anxious 
 furtive miserable They stood in little groups listening eagerly to a
 sharp faced lawyer or in sullen despair eying each other At a door a tipstaff
 laid his hand roughly on the arm of Mr Thorndike 
  Thats all right Joe  called young Mr Andrews  hes with ME   They entered
 the court and passed down an aisle to a railed enclosure in which were high oak
 chairs Again in his effort to follow Mr Thorndike was halted but the first
 tipstaff came to his rescue  All right  he signalled  hes with Mr 
 Andrews 
 Mr Andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs  You sit there  he commanded  its
 reserved for members of the bar but its all right you’re with ME 
 Distinctly annoyed slightly bewildered the banker sank between the arms of a
 chair He felt he had lost his individuality Andrews had become his sponsor 
 Because of Andrews he was tolerated Because Andrews had a pull he was permitted
 to sit as an equal among police court lawyers No longer was he Arnold Thorndike 
 He was merely the man  with Mr Andrews 
 Then even Andrews abandoned him  The judgell be here in a minute now  said the
 assistant district attorney and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the
 judges bench There he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years
 were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of Mr Andrews Seated on
 the rail with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr 
 Thorndike they laughed and talked together The subject of their discourse was
 one Mike Donlin as he appeared in vaudeville 
 To Mr Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely forgotten him He
 arose and touched his sleeve With infinite sarcasm Mr Thorndike began  My
 engagements are not pressing but 
 A court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail 
  Sit down  whispered Andrews  The judge is coming 
 Mr Thorndike sat down 
 The court attendant droned loudly words Mr Thorndike could not distinguish There
 was a rustle of silk and from a door behind him the judge stalked past He was a
 young man the type of the Tammany politician On his shrewd alert 
 Irish American features was an expression of unnatural gloom With a smile Mr 
 Thorndike observed that it was as little suited to the countenance of the young
 judge as was the robe to his shoulders Mr Thorndike was still smiling when young
 Andrews leaned over the rail 
  Stand up  he hissed Mr Thorndike stood up 
 After the court attendant had uttered more unintelligible words every one sat
 down and the financier again moved hurriedly to the rail 
  I would like to speak to him now before he begins  he whispered  I cant
 wait 
 Mr Andrews stared in amazement The banker had not believed the young man could
 look so serious 
  Speak to him NOW  exclaimed the district attorney Youve got to wait till
 your man comes up If you speak to the judge NOW   The voice of Andrews faded
 away in horror 
 Not knowing in what way he had offended but convinced that it was only by the
 grace of Andrews he had escaped a dungeon Mr Thorndike retreated to his
 arm chair 
 The clock on the wall showed him that already he had given to young Spear one
 hour and a quarter The idea was preposterous No one better than himself knew
 what his time was really worth In half an hour there was a board meeting later 
 he was to hold a post mortem on a railroad at every moment questions were being
 asked by telegraph by cable questions that involved the credit of individuals 
 of firms of even the country And the one man who could answer them was risking
 untold sums only that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice Inside the
 railed enclosure a lawyer was reading a typewritten speech He assured his honor
 that he must have more time to prepare his case It was one of immense importance 
 The name of a most respectable business house was involved and a sum of no less
 than nine hundred dollars Nine hundred dollars The contrast struck Mr 
 Thorndikes sense of humor full in the centre Unknowingly he laughed and found
 himself as conspicuous as though he had appeared suddenly in his night clothes 
 The tipstaffs beat upon the rail the lawyer he had interrupted uttered an
 indignant exclamation Andrews came hurriedly toward him and the young judge
 slowly turned his head 
  Those persons  he said  who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave
 it  As he spoke with his eyes fixed on those of Mr Thorndike the latter saw
 that the young judge had suddenly recognized him But the fact of his identity did
 not cause the frown to relax or the rebuke to halt unuttered In even icy tones
 the judge continued  And it is well they should remember that the law is no
 respecter of persons and that the dignity of this court will be enforced no
 matter who the offender may happen to be 
 Andrews slipped into the chair beside Mr Thorndike and grinned
 sympathetically 
  Sorry  he whispered  Should have warned you We wont be long now  he added
 encouragingly  As soon as this fellow finishes his argument the judgell take up
 the sentences Your man seems to have other friends Isaacs Sons are here 
 and the type writer firm who taught him but what YOU say will help most It wont
 be more than a couple of hours now 
  A couple of hours  Mr Thorndike raged inwardly A couple of hours in this place
 where he had been publicly humiliated He smiled a thin shark like smile Those
 who made it their business to study his expressions on seeing it would have
 fled Young Andrews not being acquainted with the moods of the great man added
 cheerfully  By one oclock anyway 
 Mr Thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves For all he cared now young Spear
 could go hang Andrews nudged his elbow 
  See that old lady in the front row  he whispered  Thats Mrs Spear What did I
 tell you mothers are all alike she’s not taken her eyes off you since court
 opened She knows you’re her one best bet 
 Impatiently Mr Thorndike raised his head He saw a little white  haired woman
 who stared at him In her eyes was the same look he had seen in the eyes of men
 who at times of panic fled to him beseeching entreating forcing upon him what
 was left of the wreck of their fortunes if only he would save their honor 
  And here come the prisoners  Andrews whispered  See Spear  Third man from the
 last  A long line guarded in front and rear shuffled into the court room and 
 as ordered ranged themselves against the wall Among them were old men and young
 boys well dressed clever looking rascals collarless tramps fierce eyed aliens 
 smooth shaven thin lipped Broadwayards and Spear 
 Spear his head hanging with lips white and cheeks ashen and his eyes heavy with
 shame 
 Mr Thorndike had risen and in farewell was holding out his hand to Andrews He
 turned and across the court room the eyes of the financier and the stenographer
 met At the sight of the great man Spear flushed crimson and then his look of
 despair slowly disappeared and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and
 gratitude He turned his head suddenly to the wall 
 Mr Thorndike stood irresolute and then sank back into his chair 
 The first man in the line was already at the railing and the questions put to him
 by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney
 and a court attendant His muttered answers were in turn repeated to the
 judge 
  Says he’s married naturalized citizen Lutheran Church die  cutter by
 profession 
 The probation officer her hands filled with papers bustled forward and
 whispered 
  Mrs Austin says  continued the district attorney  shes looked into this case 
 and asks to have the man turned over to her He has a wife and three children has
 supported them for five years 
  Is the wife in court  the judge said 
 A thin washed out pretty woman stood up and clasped her hands in front of
 her 
  Has this man been a good husband to you madam  asked the young judge 
 The woman broke into vehement assurances No man could have been a better husband 
 Would she take him back  Indeed she would take him back She held out her hands as
 though she would physically drag her husband from the pillory 
 The judge bowed toward the probation officer and she beckoned the prisoner to
 her 
 
 
 Part Two
 Other men followed and in the fortune of each Mr Thorndike found himself to his
 surprise taking a personal interest It was as good as a play It reminded him of
 the Sicilians he had seen in London in their little sordid tragedies Only these
 actors were appearing in their proper persons in real dramas of a life he did not
 know but which appealed to something that had been long untouched long in
 disuse It was an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because as he
 appreciated it needed expression an outlet He found this partially in
 praising through Andrews the young judge who had publicly rebuked him Mr 
 Thorndike found him astute sane his queries intelligent his comments just And
 this probation officer she too was capable was she not  Smiling at his
 interest in what to him was an old story the younger man nodded 
  I like her looks  whispered the great man  Like her clear eyes and clean skin 
 She strikes me as able full of energy and yet womanly These men when they come
 under her charge  he insisted eagerly  need money to start again don’t they 
 He spoke anxiously He believed he had found the clew to his restlessness It was
 a desire to help to be of use to these failures who had fallen and who were being
 lifted to their feet Andrews looked at him curiously  Anything you give her  he
 answered  would be well invested 
  If you will tell me her name and address  whispered the banker He was much
 given to charity but it had been perfunctory it was extended on the advice of
 his secretary In helping here he felt a genial glow of personal pleasure It was
 much more satisfactory than giving an Old Master to his private chapel 
 In the rear of the court room there was a scuffle that caused every one to turn
 and look A man who had tried to force his way past the tipstaffs was being
 violently ejected and as he disappeared he waved a paper toward Mr Thorndike 
 The banker recognized him as his chief clerk Andrews rose anxiously  That man
 wanted to get to you Ill see what it is Maybe its important 
 Mr Thorndike pulled him back 
  Maybe it is  he said dryly  But I cant see him now i’m busy 
 Slowly the long line of derelicts of birds of prey of sorry weak failures 
 passed before the seat of judgment Mr Thorndike had moved into a chair nearer to
 the rail and from time to time made a note upon the back of an envelope He had
 forgotten the time or had chosen to disregard it So great was his interest that
 he had forgotten the particular derelict he had come to serve until Spear stood
 almost at his elbow 
 Thorndike turned eagerly to the judge and saw that he was listening to a rotund 
 gray little man with beady bird like eyes who as he talked bowed and
 gesticulated Behind him stood a younger man a more modern edition of the other 
 He also bowed and behind gold eye glasses smiled ingratiatingly 
 The judge nodded and leaning forward for a few moments fixed his eyes upon the
 prisoner 
  You are a very fortunate young man  he said He laid his hand upon a pile of
 letters  When you were your own worst enemy your friends came to help you These
 letters speak for you your employers whom you robbed have pleaded with me in
 your favor It is urged in your behalf that at the time you committed the crime
 of which you are found guilty you were intoxicated In the eyes of the law that
 is no excuse Some men can drink and keep their senses It appears you can not 
 When you drink you are a menace to yourself and as is shown by this crime to the
 community Therefore you must not drink In view of the good character to which
 your friends have testified and on the condition that you do not touch liquor I
 will not sentence you to jail but will place you in charge of the probation
 officer 
 The judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to Mr Andrews It was finished 
 Spear was free and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving
 toward the door Their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been
 many Mr Thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment Even though the
 result relieved and pleased him he wished in bringing it about he had had some
 part 
 He begrudged to Isaacs Sons the credit of having given Spear his liberty 
 His morning had been wasted He had neglected his own interests and in no way
 assisted those of Spear He was moving out of the railed enclosure when Andrews
 called him by name 
  His honor  he said impressively  wishes to speak to you 
 The judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr Thorndike by the hand Then he made a
 speech The speech was about public spirited citizens who to the neglect of their
 own interests came to assist the ends of justice and fellow creatures in
 misfortune He purposely spoke in a loud voice and every one stopped to
 listen 
  The law Mr Thorndike is not vindictive  he said  It wishes only to be just 
 Nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences But when there
 is good in a man I personally want to know it and when gentlemen like
 yourself of your standing in this city come here to speak a good word for a man 
 we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen I thank you for
 coming and I wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and
 public spirited 
 It was all quite absurd and most embarrassing but inwardly Mr Thorndike glowed
 with pleasure It was a long time since any one had had the audacity to tell him
 he had done well From the friends of Spear there was a ripple of applause which
 no tipstaff took it upon himself to suppress and to the accompaniment of this 
 Mr Thorndike walked to the corridor He was pleased with himself and with his
 fellow men He shook hands with Isaacs Sons and congratulated them upon
 their public spirit and the type writer firm upon their public spirit And then
 he saw Spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully 
 Spear did not offer his hand but Mr Thorndike took it and shook it and said 
  I want to meet your mother 
 And when Mrs Spear tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how happy she
 was and how grateful he instead told her what a fine son she had and that he
 remembered when Spear used to carry flowers to town for her And she remembered
 it too and thanked him for the flowers And he told Spear when Isaacs 
 Sons went bankrupt which at the rate they were giving away their money to the
 Hebrew Hospital would be very soon Spear must come back to him And Isaacs 
 Sons were delighted at the great mans pleasantry and afterward repeated it many
 times calling upon each other to bear witness and Spear felt as though some one
 had given him a new backbone and Andrews who was guiding Thorndike out of the
 building was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had been lost when
 Thorndike became a banker 
 The chief clerk and two bank messengers were waiting by the automobile with
 written calls for help from the office They pounced upon the banker and almost
 lifted him into the car 
  Theres still time  panted the chief clerk 
  There is not  answered Mr Thorndike His tone was rebellious defiant It
 carried all the authority of a spoiled child of fortune  Ive wasted most of this
 day  he declared  and I intend to waste the rest of it Andrews  he called 
  jump in and Ill give you a lunch at Sherrys 
 The vigilant protector of the public dashed back into the building 
  Wait till I get my hat  he called 
 As the two truants rolled up the avenue the spring sunshine warmed them the sense
 of duties neglected added zest to their holiday and young Mr Andrews laughed
 aloud 
 Mr Thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly  I was wondering   said Andrews 
  how much it cost you to keep Spear out of jail 
  I don’t care  said the great man guiltily  it was worth it

 Captured Moments by Will Shetterly
 
 I remember Papas stopbox a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home
 for his birthday It was huge and inefficient and she should never have spent
 so many pesos on a toy but Papa would not let her return it He used it to
 preserve baby tomatoes cucumbers and strawberries in translucent cubes that he
 stored in the pantry for spring time meals in the middle of winter Mama kept
 her mink jacket a family hand me down safe from time in a stopbox and lent
 the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection Sometimes they would let us
 little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we
 begged them for its release usually a few hours after enclosing it 
 When my father died a year after my mother my sisters and I cleaned out their
 apartment We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes I took mine home 
 where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play One night when
 I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone I used my own capturador a
 sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora to undo the stopbox Bringing my face close
 to the shoes I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing
 up that symbol of their love for me 
 The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they
 were encased But as soon as I coughed I laughed and I did not try to kill
 myself that night 
 
 
 Let me begin again 
 
 
 I like life on the resort worlds    always have and after the upcoming
 mindwipe always will Last year I rented a small house on Vega IV a sea
 world all islands and reefs and archipelagos turquoise waters and aquamarine
 skies sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova Theres
 only one city called Nuevo Acapulco in La Enciclopedia del Empirio de la
 Humanidad its Napulco to the locals The Napulcans are mostly emigrants from
 Polaris II the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is
 that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists Now the Napulcans profit from their
 Hispanic siblings 
 I don’t mean to sound cynical I suppose I wish to show that i’m still capable
 of a certain authorial distance a semblance of dispassionate observation The
 following events may indicate otherwise 
 In fine tourist tradition most homes on Vega IV are named Mine was The
 Sleeping Flamingo and its outer walls were coral pink Were they
 mood sensitive they would have changed as I first viewed them The rental
 agent an attractive Napulcan named Tasha Cortez was not mood sensitive
 either She said  Its beautiful isn’t it Señor Flynn   
 My instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat
 and take me elsewhere But she was young and attractive as I have said and may
 say again and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn
 that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism And then because a
 playwright cannot resist a promising line I said  Your Sleeping Flamingo
 should be put to sleep   
 To say her face fell would do a disservice to Tasha and to literature Allow me
 my self indulgences as you would those of a dying man    when I convince my
 mindsmith to permit the wipe there will be another Bernardo Flynn one who
 knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here Her brows drew
 together creasing the lovely caramel colored skin around her eyes and showing
 the pattern for an old womans wrinkles on her forehead Her lower lip a trifle
 too narrow for her face perhaps her only physical flaw thrust forward slightly
 as she started to speak She caught herself slid her jaw infinitesimally back
 into place and said  You don’t like it   
 I laughed What could I do  I clapped her shoulder to show I was not laughing at
 her  Like it  I hate it despise it abhor it Its gaudy graceless 
 pretentious    That house is an affront to taste and intelligence I should buy
 it to raze it but I am not so kind hearted I might however rent it   
 I think she only heard the last words of my speech  You will   
  It amuses me Show me around and then I shall decide   
  Of course Señor Flynn   
  And stop calling me señor Not even Los Mundos is so polite Call me
 Bernardo   
  If you wish   
  I beg you change the color of the walls at the very least   
  But of course   The house walls shifted from pink to lavender 
 I stared 
  Hows that   
 I looked at her 
  Worse   
 I nodded  I would not have thought it possible   
 She frowned  It is rather ugly   
  Thoroughly ugly   I corrected with smile 
  Obscenely ugly   said she smiling too 
  No   I pointed  It has no tower   
  I can fix that   She reached for another dial on the house controls 
  Dont you dare   Her wrist when I grabbed it was smooth and strong and warm
 in my fingers  Ill take it Exactly as it is   
  You will   
  I must God knows what you might do to it next   Reluctantly I released her
 hand 
 The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise Cloudwood had been used in
 a Mediterranean manner making the house seem primitive and civilized at the
 same time The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired From the
 living room the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that Tasha
 asked if I felt ill All I could say was  No i’m in love   We both thought I
 referred to the vista 
 
 
 Its strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life 
 forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one
 would remember and suddenly the forgotten in revenge rears up to savage the
 unwary So it was as I wrote the preceding My heart convulsed and I left this
 manuscript for a three day spree Apparently I was so successful that it lasted
 a week and a half Not bad for an eighty three year old even for one who has
 his rejuve every month And if I can brag and digress so easily this must not
 be painful enough to merit a mindwipe yes  
 No I abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately 
 thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them 
 even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight My mindsmith is not
 so understanding She says I am emotionally a child to which I reply  Of
 course Why else would I come to you   This logic does not soothe her she says
 I must wait three weeks Three Such is the law I say I do not care about law 
 I care about service and she should care about money Enough I went on a spree 
 and it must have been a good one I hope the wipe is as successful with my time
 on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here I dimly remember three bedpartners
 who were probably human and one that I hope was delirium I will not answer the
 phone for a week no matter whose face appears on it 
 I keep evading the issue But which issue  The issue of why I am evading the
 issue or the issue itself  To deal with the first it hurts to remember If I
 am capable of love I loved Tasha Cortez If I am not I had the perfect mirror
 for my narcissism 
 As for the issue itself i’m no longer sure what I want to record The
 playwright in me wants every scene of our time together The editor says no 
 only those that are relevant The sufferer says no only those which cause no
 pain And the artist says no only those which cause the most pain for those
 would be the truest memories 
 So I shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise I will not talk of the
 first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together I can remember
 similar things with others Tashas witchery lay in making old acts new Is that
 love  Probably not But it is something marvelous and rare which is surely a
 sign of love 
 If my love for her was the only important thing I would leave a holo of her
 with a note  Dear Future this is Tasha Cortez You loved her With warmest
 regards Your Past   
 Enough Tasha and I walked through The Sleeping Flamingo together and I decided
 to buy it Then    
 
 
 This is not easy I stand up I walk around I pretend someone makes a vid about
 a writer and I must enact every cliche I cannot decide whats important But I
 have learned something writing trivializes The Tasha who was is not the Tasha
 in this file The Tasha in this file is not even the Tasha I loved and thought I
 knew The Tasha in this file would walk through a net show in half an hour 
 including commercials and just before an ad for Figueros Flash Diapers   
 Keeps Baby Driest she    
 Tasha is not the whole of what happened on Vega IV I must also write about
 Emiliano Gabriel Malaquez 
 
 
 Future Self you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between
 the last sentence and this Not another spree   at least not like the other I
 have been re reading all our favorite books    
 But neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects do we  
 I want to pick up with Tasha and me walking about The Sleeping Flamingo and
 then for the sake of literary convenience to say that from a corner of the
 yard I saw a neighboring house and the sight filled me with darkest
 forebodings But the truth is that Tasha pointed it out from the one place where
 it could barely be seen and I only felt envy that it had been designed by
 someone with understated good taste  Who lives there   I asked 
  No one   Tasha replied 
 Truth is always more boring than fiction For Malaquez did not move into Dreams
 End until four or five months after I    we  how does one speak to ones future
 self     occupied The Flamingo 
 I do not plan to write a book this narrative must move more quickly Tasha and
 I became lovers that evening after a good dinner of paella at her apartment I
 made some small joke afterward about approving of her firms business
 incentives and she cried Consoling her I began to suspect I loved her I
 moved into The Flamingo the next day and she gave up her apartment three weeks
 later to join me It was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most
 people believe it does not happen at all the sort of romance that sustains the
 hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love Which is to
 say you and me Future Self 
 Who was Tasha Cortez  She was a twenty four year old Terran Standard NApulcan
 who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunts real estate
 firm Her family said she did it to support her father who was dying of a
 particularly painful degenerative disease Tasha said she woke up one morning
 convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables she would become
 one 
 She did not like my plays I had impressed her because I was famous and amusing
 and not as I had hoped because I was a great artist That bothered yes and
 intrigued me until I realized that she was bored by most plays movies and
 vid She did not like being a spectator I often told her that she should have a
 bio check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance I often told her
 too many things 
 Search  Emiliano Malaquez  and youll find he’s a master of the  captured
 moment  school of sculpture Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work 
 To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living
 models He accents the illusion of reality   I paraphrase his entry in La
 Enciclopedia Humanica   by doing life size scenes in  the full round   never the
 easier frontal or three quarters view Moreover he never did portraits of
 famous people his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared
 to it As is typical of his school his pieces are sealed in stopboxes The
 shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that were looking at an
 instant snatched from under the hooves of time They say the cubes will outlast
 planets and suns that when the universe dies the works of Malaquez and his
 followers will be the last things seen in the final wink of Gods eye 
 Yes Self I am also bothered that this observation ignores half eaten cheese
 sandwiches incomplete insect collections and locks of infants hair forgotten
 in closets basements and warehouses 
 You see the inspiration for my latest play  Captured Moments   The mindwipe
 will take its creation from my future self   but time too often does that
 without aid The plays second act concludes with the last fight between Tasha
 and me I have disguised us in the play and deleted one brief melodramatic
 interchange Now I will mention it in case I You decide to restore it Shortly
 before she left Tasha said  You steal from life for art Bernardo Youll
 impoverish yourself   I only snarled at her and    
 My story leaps ahead of itself Let me retreat and retrench 
 One night during Napulcos mild winter Tasha returned to The Flamingo saying 
  Nardo Nardo Guess what   
 My mind was on other things  You wish to become pregnant  I suppose I could
 assist a friend Purely for the sake of the race of course     
  Ever the altruist Still if I do decide we could practice     
 Later I said  Youve been chosen to succeed the Emperor   
  What   
  My guess   
 She batted at my nose like a cat  Silly Nardo   
  Then I give up   
  Emil Malaquez is buying the house up the hill   
  Oh   
  You don’t know who he is   
  Well   
  Nardo   One of the many things I liked about her was that she often thought me
 shockingly ignorant 
  Thats uh   I am never so quick witted in person as I am on the page 
 Especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant 
  You know the sculptor he’s had shows in Brazil and New Madrid and everywhere 
 He may be more famous than you   
  Imagine that   I remembered an article in The Medusa and a photo of a work in
 which  peso notes fell like confetti onto a small Undersider sexlessly young
 in grimy oversized clothing The childs face was a warground for wonder and
 mistrust Imprisoned light from forgotten streetlamps snagged itself on metal
 threads in the fluttering pesos The stars themselves might have fallen on the
 Undersider and the event would have been no less strange no less miraculous  A
 great artist will grace this world then   
  Nardo   She was never tolerant of my ego 
  Well Whats this more famous than me person like   
  I didn’t meet him jealous old one   
  Too bad If I thought he could free me from you     
  Hah   She wrapped her arms around my stomach  Youll never be free of me old
 man   
 The next evening she arrived with a stack of glistening stopboxes containing
 sushi sashimi oysters in their shells and Terran vegetables fresh plucked
 from their hydroponic beds Wondering about the reason for her extravagance I
 asked how work had gone that day 
  Emil came in he’s taking Dreams End   
  Emil   
  Youve no memory left old one Emil Malaquez   
  Ah You did that to test my affections   
  What   
  Calling him by his first name I did that in a comedy once Nights with Karl
 and Groucho It was before your time   
  Oh   
  The critics liked it   
  Im glad   A moment later  Thats not why I called him Emil   
  No   
  No We lunched together he’s nice   
  Oh   
  It wasn’t like that   
  Youre free   
  Of course Still it wasn’t like that You think I sleep with every famous
 person I meet   
 As you may have guessed we had talked about such things I do not claim ours
 was a perfect affair only a wonderful one 
  Tasha     
  Do you   
  No   
  Good I invited him to dinner tomorrow   
  Oh   
  Hell be our neighbor You say were becoming too insular that we need to
 socialize     
  Ive socialized for sixty three years   
  Nardo   
  Yes   
  How should I reply   Her voice had grown quiet and I began to feel some guilt 
 I had it is true told her that we needed other company than our own I said
 this from years of learning that romances consume themselves without other fuel 
 But knowing this did not mean I wanted it 
 I said  Truthfully   It was the statement of a younger and crueler man than I 
 She screamed  I havent socialized with Terras elite for most of my life I
 havent socialized with hardly anyone for hardly any of my life And I invite a
 neighbor one nice lonely man     
  Im sorry   
     who took me to    What   
  Im sorry Truly   
  Oh   She studied me as a suspicious puppy might then said  Im sorry too   
  I suppose I sound like i’m bragging when I talk of the things i’m tired of   
  Only because you are   She smiled 
 I had to grin so I did  True   
  He may come to dinner   
  If you wish he may be dinner   
  I love you   
  And I you   Months earlier we might have sought a bed a couch or a
 comfortable chair at this point Instead I asked  Is he handsome   
  Youre jealous   
  A tiny bit Extremely   
  Content yourself old one he’s four inches shorter than I his nose is big and
 broken and     
  This is cosmetic   
  Hes not that ugly I think theyre his natural features   
  Interesting   
  You could write a play about someone like him   
  Perhaps   
  I think his face is his form of vanity Its the reverse of you with those
 ridiculous stomach muscles Old men should be fat   
  Is Emil   
  Yes   
  I am jealous Ill eat two dinners tonight Five deserts   
 She giggled And then we did make love 
 
 

 i’ve been thinking about the mindwipe now two days away Who said that those
 who forget the past are doomed to repeat it  I fear that may be true for me Add
 this to the reasons I write now to remember something perhaps even to learn    
 Emil Malaquez arrived after sundown carrying a small package wrapped in what
 looked like real paper His evening dress was formal expensive and slightly
 stained as that of all forgetful artists should be He was a jovial man with an
 easy laugh and even uglier than Tasha had suggested I liked him immediately 
  Señor Malaquez   
  Please Call me Emil You must be Bernardo Tashas told me much about you   
  All of it outrageous praise   
  All of it   
  Ah she is wonderfully perceptive   
 He raised an eyebrow then guffawed  Has she said as much about me   
  She thinks you are a genius Do come in   
  Thank you   Stepping into the living room he said  A beautiful house   
  Im glad you came after dark   
 Tasha by accident or design had found an innocently erotic posture on the
 couch where she lay with a book of Mduvian prints  Emil   She leapt up  I
 did not expect you     
  So early   
     on time Its unforgiveable but you’re forgiven   She nodded at the
 package  Whats that   
  For your kindness in inviting a stranger into your home   He held it out and
 with a delighted  Oh   Tasha snatched it from him to rip away the paper 
 
 
 I stopped writing and only the thought that I might miss the mindwipe kept me
 from another spree I went walking but after Napulco Rio seems no fit abode
 for a creature of flesh I walked from this hotel to the old city past the end
 of the slidewalks and softwalks to the hard cracked pavement of City Park But
 Undersiders left me alone Perhaps they recognized a fellow ghost So I
 returned and slept and now the mindwipe is thirteen hours away 
 
 
 The side of Malaquezs parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen
 of solid air Bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a
 friend or a bringer of food Tasha oohed in awe I said  Frodos been visiting
 you eh   
 Malaquez said  Your pet   
  Hardly He lives around here somewhere I suppose he was attracted to the
 commotion up the hill   
  Ah   Malaquez said  Why Frodo   
 Tasha said  A little fellow with big furry feet What else could he be
 called   She handed the sculpture to me 
 I almost dropped it I expected it to weigh no more than a holo  Heavy   I
 said as if he might not have known 
 He laughed  My last piece was of four old Undersiders crouched around a trash
 fire Be glad someone didn’t toss that to you   He spoke of his art with the
 enthusiasm of a seven year old  Um I should wait to importune you but   He
 grinned shyly  A confession and then a request And then you must forgive me
 for being so forward Its not easy for me to ask a favor   
  Relax   I said  Its easy for me to turn one down   
 He glanced at me and decided I was joking The surprising thing is that I was 
  Good My last show     
     was glorious   Tasha said 
     was kindly received   he said  But an artist who would stay first among his
 fellows can tell when he begins to fail   
  Oh   I hoped no one would bring up my last three plays 
  I must change my subject matter No more urchins dopers vagrants or whores 
 I want to do more traditional portraits   He spoke quickly prepared to be
 rejected  Would you permit me to do one of you  I would pay     
  Never   I said 
  Ah   He shrugged lightly 
  Nardo   Tasha said  Its an honor     
  Of course   I said  Thats why I cannot take payment   
  Oh  Oh Thank you   Malaquez turned to Tasha  And you as well  Perhaps the two
 of you together   
 Her eyes became circles at the idea of being as she undoubtedly thought it 
 immortalized by Emil Malaquez Catching herself she said casually  Oh   And
 then she smiled laughed loudly at herself in the way that always made me think
 how much I loved her and said  My God yes yes yes   For a perfect moment 
 Emil and Tasha and I were one entity laughing until our lungs hurt 
 This is torture I had not considered that I might not write to learn but to
 punish myself Let me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in
 a few sentences After giving Emil full rights to a sculpture of Tasha and me 
 we had a good dinner of curried clam chowder lobsters boiled on Terra and
 unstopped still steaming on NApulco and cinnamon custard for desert Then we
 went out for a late swim 
 I had drunk too much I confess though we all had Somehow Tasha and I began
 to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz as inconsequential a topic as I can
 imagine She had studied it in school so she thought herself as an expert I
 once had a neighbor who played it constantly loudly and badly so I thought I
 knew it better Malaquez tried to mediate but I saw him as siding with Tasha 
 So I think did she The subject shifted from music to Tashas obsession with
 fame undoubtedly by a leap that I made She had no choice but to follow I do
 not remember any of this well just now nor do I care to Those who are truly
 curious may look at the last act of  Captured Moments   I remember suggesting 
 with characteristic tact that she add Emil to her small list of major
 accomplishments 
 Malaquez glanced away embarrassed Tasha looked at me as if to say  I will  
 She said  I feel sorry for you Nardo Ill see Emil home   
  Yes   I said  Do that   and did not care what she did or why 
 Emil asked  Youre all right   I muttered something he must have interpreted as
 assent They both walked up to Emils home while I watched the scarlet moonlight
 ripple on distant waves Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself I
 finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping
 Flamingo to drink myself to sleep 
 She had not come home when I woke in mid morning I waited and drank a glass of
 MorningAfter and three cups of coffee and wondered whether our affair could
 survive the events of the night and whether I wanted it to Perhaps I should
 have invited Emil to stay but even then I knew that sex was not the problem
 between Tasha and me The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between
 compromise and capitulation between symbols and substance Shortly before noon 
 I climbed the sandy path to Dreams End rehearsing my apology slowing only to
 pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet 
 Malaquez answered the door in blood red pajamas and a black silk robe Sixty
 years ago in a similar situation I had broken my knuckles on someones face I
 merely said  Is Tasha here   
 He pursed his lips slightly then nodded  Yes   
  May I see her   When he hesitated I said  Last night was my fault I hold it
 against neither of you Please Let me talk to her   
  I     
  Please   
 He looked me and at last said  Very well   
 We walked through his house in silence It was as attractive and as impersonal
 as a decorator could arrange for tenants of unknown taste A tall narrow
 stopbox stood in the center of one room sand trickled forever downward while
 beads of water splashed across the sands path If that was Malaquezs work it
 was a very minor effort But then I was in no mood to consider art I only
 wanted to despise the man who had slept with my lover That was easier than
 despising myself 
 He paused before a bedroom door  I should go in first To prepare her   
 I smiled  She handles surprise surprisingly well   
  What would it hurt   
  True Go ahead Tell her   I shrugged  Tell her I love her   
 He studied me then said  Im sorry things happened this way Bernardo I
 didn’t anticipate last night     
  Im very good at making things happen this way But if Tasha will forgive me
     
 He nodded repeated  I am sorry   then slipped into the next room I waited in
 the dark carpeted hall A warm breeze came from silent vents above me I heard
 no voices until Malaquez said  Enter   
 I blinked when I opened the door Sunlight filled Malaquezs bedroom Tasha lay
 sprawled nude on a rumpled bed Her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the
 beds teak frame She was looking slightly to my left smiling with trust and
 satisfaction like one sexually content Malaquez stood near her pointing
 something at my chest Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them it
 shimmered around Tasha 
 The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great
 Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor Malaquez was not prepared for me to
 react so quickly or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not
 have a gesture I would not make a poignant moment of repentence wonder 
 despair or love Had he been faster he could have had rage I threw a chair at
 him As he fell I scrambled onto him my knees pinning his arms my fingers
 probing his neck 
 I shouted  Where is she  Tell me or Ill kill     
 He began to cry  She left Earlier this morning     
 Her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed I hit him with the back of my
 hand  Tell me Malaquez   
  She wanted to be famous She did Now she will be   
 He seemed to expect me to understand  Where   I demanded squeezing his throat
 until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture 
 I stared at the naked Tasha Most of his story I have pieced together since but
 I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy
 throat He had made his name with a home capturador He began with small animals
 and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders people who would never be missed Now
 he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me and when someone came
 looking he would say we had gone island hopping in our windboat Our boat would
 disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose His
 story would stand in either case 
 I wanted him to tell me more but he babbled begging me to forgive him to
 understand I did not listen I took the capturador a matte black Tiempo
 Capturado from his grip and studied it not really thinking about it or
 Malaquez or Tasha I think I was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was
 art so we accepted it as art Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that
 humanity made that would outlive our species But I was probably only looking at
 my reflection in the capturadors lens Had he said then that I should use it on
 myself I might have 
 That moment passed I looked at Malaquez His eyes opened wider while we watched
 each other His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound 
 I turned to touch the cube that was Tashas crypt She smiled in trust or
 pleasure or pride an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever and I could
 never know why 
 The controls of the capturador were more complex than those of a kitchen model 
 but I recognized the unstop tab I could free Tasha If I did one of three
 things would happen Most likely she would be meat   there is a reason why
 stopboxes are most often used in kitchens Less likely she would live the rest
 of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slugs And the tiniest chance of
 all she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emils bedroom and then
 she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal 
 As I put my hand on the impervious surface of Tashas stopbox I heard Malaquez
 run for the door 
 It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we
 should hate Know this my future self Thanks to us Emil Malaquezs name will
 live as long as his masterpiece  A Self Portrait Anguish   endures 
 And Tasha  I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate 
 I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame some
 critics already say  Waking With Tasha  is Malaquezs finest work If science
 finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emils art perhaps the I who reads
 this file will know that my decision is wise But I cannot stop thinking that I
 was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death My fear is that she
 would live and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez
 translated her into a thing that can be kept admired and loved 
 For in my way I have done the same thing 
 I am ready for the mindwipe now 

 
 
 





>Hotel California

Fact Sound is a vibration Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium and in space there is no
medium So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn’t keep the air in I heard nothing After the
first whoosh of the air being sucked away there was lightning but no thunder Eyes bulging in
panic but no screams Quiet and peaceful right  Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter
about his girl back on Earth and that all expenses paid vacation for two she won last time he was on leave I
swore if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again giving the camera a cheesy thumbs up
from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches Id kiss a monkey Metaphorically of course 

Fact If before all the air is sucked out of the ship a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself
into a space suit that person has less than twenty four hours to live This is more than the person would have
sans space suit Me I found a space suit but it was statistically unlikely that I and whomever else has
followed suit pun intended would manage to repair our ship before the less than twenty four hours are up 
yes studies have been done So twenty four hours Give or take 

About the time I was composing my last words in my head trying not to think too much about what suffocating
felt like that’s when I heard a bell 

My first thought I was going crazy Twenty four hours of silence vacuum remember was I hallucinating
noises now 

I heard it again It was a fine bell reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals Id
seen in documentaries And accompanying the bell I saw a light 

Now there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense First the whole in a vacuum
whys there a bell thing Second I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship and any conceivable
light sources were not within view starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less
bright 

These signals were the heralds of my saviors 

The first words they said to me meant nothing I wasn’t listening I didn’t care I was going to live I was
going to keep breathing Next to those nothing else mattered The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth and
all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life giving substances and how breathing was like
sex only better I reserved the right to revise this opinion later 

When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue I looked around The ship it was odd and
old either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldnt tell what make it was and somehow the crew
standing around me fit the same description a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk And me I guess I was
one more piece in their puzzle I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest one more stranded survivor who was
found 

I was now one of them 

This story its our story The survivors of the unfortunate accidents the catastrophic malfunctions the
fateful crashes this is us Floating alone each of us facing the silence of the vacuum we were found 

Once found we can never be lost 

This is our Hotel California 

We can never leave 

 So i’m on a ship now  You do this a lot 

A woman introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful shrugged  Now and then 

 What about my crewmates  Why didn’t you save them  As much as Jesse had irritated me I didn’t like the
picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave body swollen and bloated Who would tell his girl how he
had died 

 Couldnt  said the captain Jefferson he called himself clean shaven and smart a picture of the perfect
entrepreneur An opportunist and a businessman that was Jefferson  Were selective about our passengers  he
continued  You fit the bill They didn’t 

Tiffany she looked at the captain grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder She turned
to me  Come on  she said before I could say anything else  lets get you settled in  No time for
questions No time for answers 

 The ship had all the usual accoutrements artificial gravity tastefully painted walls sound dampeners to
keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane recycled air systems and a few
less usual lush carpeting lighting that was decorative as well as functional spacious corridors The
occasional painting hung on the wall generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met 
primarily Glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways music voices the aroma of real food 

This was heaven No seventy two virgins but it would do 

 Where are we going  I asked 

Tiffany looked back  To your quarters Its not far you’re not going to get blisters 

 No I meant wheres the ship going  Whats our destination 

Tiffany she stopped walking She gave me a look pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to
share the news  Honey  she said  Youre going to be delighted Destination everywhere Destination
nowhere 

This was hell I died in those last moments suffocating on my own exhaled breath and this this was my
reward 

Fact The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty eight degrees Fahrenheit is three
hundred and forty three meters per second or one thousand one hundred twenty five feet per second 

It took me a couple days to realize I was in fact still alive I mean sure Id had my moment of elation
when I had first realized Id been rescued but it didn’t sink in After watching my ship tear apart after
spending a good twenty three hours floating in silence in the wreck wondering whether I was currently facing
stars belonging to the constellation Libra or the constellation Orion when those stars were viewed from Earth 
wondering what it felt like to suffocate and after the feeling that yes I was in fact going to die alone in
space had sunk in it took time for that feeling to dissipate 

Fact I wasn’t dead 

After I realized this I left my quarters The lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official
meals were taking place but I hadnt bothered to acknowledge the invitations It hadnt seemed relevant 
somehow given that I was still reeling over the explosion the deaths of my crewmates and the rescue Ive
heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock I guess I was working my way through them Food was
delivered to my quarters Initially I couldnt figure out why I hadnt requested any be sent Then I realized 
someone must have noticed I hadnt left and was nice enough to send food my way The accompanying bottle of
wine was a nice touch I must have consumed it too because later on the plates and the bottle were both
empty I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed staring up at the little etched swirls in the
ceiling or slumped in the old fashioned armchair staring out the windows at the stars I did a lot of staring
and not moving 

Man was it good to be done with that stage 

It was time to find out what hell looked like 

Fact Hell is other people Sure the ship was spacious We didn’t pick up many passengers just the select 
special few scattered here and there between the stars But we were all on this ship and we were on it
together 

Cliques form in any decent sized group of people Me I was singled out by Sarah an unassuming
forty something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the
other She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro
cream dip onto a plate The plate by the way was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish 
paprika dusted deviled eggs toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese and balls of
meat smothered in a tomato based sauce Luxurious even compared to the fare one would find in the high class
space stations and pleasure cruisers Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship it
was mouthwateringly lip smackingly gorgeous I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days
had been similarly amazing I decided it couldnt have been 

 Liking the taste of the sweet life eh  i’m Sarah and this is Alexis you must be the new pickup  She
looked me over approvingly  Come on let’s get you a glass of champagne  I looked longingly at the slices of
cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar but didn’t protest 

The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot It turned toward Sarahs wave and acknowledged her with a
nod moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her I marveled at the robots
smoothness and coordination Clearly it was a high end model Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and
pulled me away from the bar for more introductions with Alexis trailing after us 

I spent the evening listening mostly Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food
provided No one minded Sarahs inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter 
Ray a plump man who was grey where he wasn’t bald Zheng short and dark and lean with a very intense gaze 
He made me a little uncomfortable Kishori petite her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached
nearly to her waist I categorized them based on their appearances hoping Id be able to pick them out of the
crowd again later Most of their chatter was meaningless to me stories of day to day activities how so and so
had been seen in so and sos table at lunch and my wasn’t that a surprise and why hadnt the chef concocted
this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night but of course those rolled meat
pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth didn’t they and this was somehow an interesting fact 

After the first half hour I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight I
wasnt learning anything useful I could have started asking questions but I wanted to get my bearings first 
Tonight was for observation I didn’t bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more
interesting people though They all looked the same clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less
apt the hangers on the circle with whom the gossip was shared I wondered at the ship instead All the fine
food and the ornamental lighting it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain If the barkeep was any
indication I suspected similarly high class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship How they were all
powered was a mystery as good as the technology got a quality robot like that was still an energy sink It was
the brain mostly the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it
did ate up a lot of resources 

Sarahs crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled all seemingly pleased to have
a new set of ears to talk at I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised
to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film done in the style of old flatscreen
movies that I had seen during off time at Geminia Station 

By the end of the evening when I finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room a satisfying
haze had settled on my mind It was nice I decided This ship This life The nagging questions about where
the ship had come from and what its purpose in rescuing me was still nagged but somehow seemed less urgent 
Did it truly matter what the ships origin was and why Jefferson had saved me if now I was content 

Fact Its easy to fall into patterns I would wake late checking the clock on my rooms lightscreen to
make sure I hadnt slept through brunch I would join the rest of the ship for meals and I would take my turn
in the weight room I would watch old films on the entertainment screens taking mental notes for later
dinnertime discussions I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks I would attend afternoon dance
classes so that when the evening dances came around modeled after the historical social gatherings of several
hundred years prior I would be less of an embarrassment to myself 

I did not ask questions I told myself I should I told myself that tonight the observation period would
end and Id start puzzling out the ships mystery But I fell under the ships sway Bereft of my previous
familiar life I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and
then he was mostly her favorite dancing partner she confided to us one night that his conversational skills
left something to be desired I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth this was my long awaited vacation 
my clean break and my temporary retreat Id try contacting those friends tomorrow I continued to care little
for shipwide gossip but our discussions of films and flicks old and new brought out my artistic 
story loving argumentative side a side of me Id tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an
engineer It was a good life if surreal But I wasn’t sure I wanted the dream stage to end 

Fact Some places are timeless Days passed weeks passed but I couldnt tell if it had been months or
years since I was rescued All there was all I remembered was a blur Gathering for drinks in the parlors 
playing dress up with all the fine clothes I found in the closets some of it modern some of it period dress
for special themed events idling in the lounges Now and then a new face mingled in the crowd Other faces
washed out fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the
engines 

One of these evenings we were gathered in the South Ballroom for post dinner drinks lounging on couches
and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor The South was in the title to
suggest that there were more ballrooms There werent Sarahs circle had picked up another newcomer 
Adrienne a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on
Earth let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her Maybe it was her curiosity asking a
question I should have asked long before that turned the conversation serious maybe there was just something
special about that evening Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life hitting some threshold or some
breaking point Regardless when Adrienne asked what the ships purpose was we all gave it a measure of
thought We dredged up half fledged theories and inchoate explanations tossing these out the same way we
pitched ideas about the art films 

 I believe well see the end of the universe  said Tiffany Captains cohort she had a glass of
orange brown liquid in one hand it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor She swirled it
speculatively I watched Adrienne She tilted her head listening not speaking 

 Impossible  said Zheng sitting in the chair to her left  We cant live that long 

 Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think  said Jefferson Yeah the captain was there with the
rest of us He didn’t drink but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques 

 Maybe well travel at the speed of light and we wont age  said Sarah setting her wine glass on the
little round end table by her couch  Maybe were already traveling at the speed of light  

Tiffany she nodded eagerly  Relatively says it all 

Zheng scoffed  Also impossible Even if we were traveling at ninety nine percent of the speed
of light thats assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible because it isnt wed
still age Wed just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us 

 And  said Sarah  Aging is relative anyway Besides I would’nt  mind being around forever Give our
ancestors purpose Keep their dreams alive 

 New hypothesis  suggested Kishori slipping into the conversation  No ones immortal In fact the
opposite Were all going to die 

 Bleak  commented Zheng  But I like it  He grinned at Sarah who frowned Ray took a drink from his glass
of ice water and shook his head 

 Were all going to die so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have  Kishori gestured to the
bar the carpets the paintings  All the luxuries money can buy 

Tiffany took a drink thinking  All the luxuries money can buy  she echoed 

Zheng looked skeptical  Paid for how 

 Smuggling  responded Kishori Matter of fact Jefferson snorted amused  Think about it  Kishori
continued  where else would we get the money to buy all this 

 Renegade smugglers So whats our cargo eh captain  Zheng joked leaning back in his chair with his
glass of wine 

Jefferson shook his head and stood up  Ill leave you to your speculation  he said A chorus of good
nights followed him out the door 

After the captain left Zheng leaned in He set his glass down on an end table steepled his fingers
together  Were revolting  he told us  And I don’t mean that you disgust me No were the start of a
rebellion Did you hear what the captain said earlier  He means were going to change the future The universe
as we know it wont be the same 

 Thats dumb  said Sarah  Wouldnt we know it if we were part of a rebellion 

Zheng shook his head  The captain selected us for a reason He has inside intelligence how else would he
know where to find us  He knows about us 

 Thats still dumb  said Sarah  Inside intelligence  don’t you remember theres not exactly one big
galactic government from which to steal information 

 I still like my idea  said Tiffany 

Me I followed Adriennes example and didn’t speak up fabricating excuses to myself to stay safely in
gather info observation mode though I thought Zheng had a point Jefferson didn’t share how he found people 
He didn’t share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were or why he saved some people but not others But then
again no one asked I guess we all figured he knew what he was doing He had been at this savior business
longer than any of us I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that 

 Were going to mean something  Zheng was saying  What we do rebelling against the oppression of the many
governments that oppose us were going to leave a legacy  He sounded certain Enthusiastic even 

Ray he shook his head and broke the quiet hed held most of the evening  Youve got it all wrong  He
looked from Sarah to Adrienne to Zheng to Kishori and Tiffany to me  Obviously we cant last longer than
the rest of the universe We arent giving anyone purpose Were not even going to leave a legacy All were
doing is existing All were doing is eating and drinking and shitting breathing and fucking and nothing
important ever We arent special 

 Again bleak  commented Zheng Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet She leaned forward setting her
elbows on the foot stool in front of her 

 You never know when it will end  Ray continued not addressing any one of us in particular  You cant
hold on forever even if you don’t ever ever want to forget How long until the memories slip away  How long
until all you remember is this the ship the thick red carpeting the chandeliers the empty conversations you
hold with the other shells who used to be people  When your life the reason you lived the people and faces
and places the emotions you felt who and what you loved when all that is gone faded what will you have
left 

I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship I wondered why if he had such an unpropitious outlook he
hadnt tried to change his situation I wanted to ask but he was still talking and I was too self conscious
to interrupt 

 You can try to hold on  said Ray  You can try and try and try Repeat stories to yourself in the
artificial night sketch faces in your mind You can make their names your mantra But words if you repeat
them enough times lose their meaning Emily emily em ill ee em i lee eh mill ee eh mih lee My wifes name 
once Repeat it enough times its just a sound No longer grounded 

Ray he said  If we last forever if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out it wont
mean a thing to us We wont care that were last and we wont care that there are no more stars We arent
angels Were just dumb and lucky 

 Pure dumb luck  he said 

 Struck a nerve huh  said Zheng 

 Sorry  said Ray 

 How long ago was that  asked Adrienne  Leaving your wife I mean Traveling on this ship 

Ray he looked down at his hands folded together in his lap fingers interlaced  I don’t know  he said 
We were all quiet for a moment Ray shrugged then got up and left We let him go Silent Self conscious More
excuses were made and after a few moments only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom She looked
across the circle of couches at me 

 Whats your theory  she asked me 

I shrugged 

 How long have you been here 

 Not that long  I said  A couple weeks I guess Maybe a month or two 

 Why don’t you know for sure  she asked 

I shrugged I hadnt been counting days 

 What did you do before this  How were you found 

 I was an engineer  I explained how my ship had malfunctioned no warning at all The explosions the
impossible rescue  I don’t know how Jefferson knew to find me there 

She nodded  The ship I was on I guess that’s what happened too Some vital part broke and well 
boom It was all so fast  She took a sip of her drink plain water because she had explained
earlier she had never liked the taste of alcohol then fixed her gaze on me  Im going to figure it out  she
said  How and why this ship exists Ill figure it out then i’m going to find a way home 

I paced my room that night unable to sleep The more I thought about it the less sense the ship made 
Worse Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question I had spent weeks asking nothing contentedly
getting nowhere 

Fact Adrienne intimidated me 

Fact Its too easy to fall into patterns 

I resolved to break the pattern 

Another evening another chandeliered room another swirl of conversations and dances and hor doevres 
Another circle of chairs and couches another uncomfortable question 

 Has anyone ever left  Adrienne looked at each of us in turn 

Ray exchanged a glance with Zheng 

Sarah frowned  Now that you mention it I havent seen Alexis in days I assumed he was indisposed 
Kishori nodded in agreement 

I looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow  What 

 Well  Ray said slowly  People do leave The approximate number of people at any given event
is always the same But we see new faces 

 Youre sure its not just some people being indisposed    asked Adrienne using Sarahs
phrasing 	

Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table  Keep
adding people long enough regardless you get more overall A couple people staying in their rooms even if
you switch out the people wont make a difference  He dropped the pecans back into the dish one by one 

 So where do they go  Adrienne focused on Zheng 

I cut in  Maybe a better question is does anyone ever come back 

Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance Kishori chewed her lip Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink 
After a moment Ray said  I don’t think so 

 Are there patterns  Adrienne asked  Who leaves 

Again there was an uncomfortable moment of silence I hazarded a guess  You don’t notice do you 

Sarah looked indignant  Of course we notice But well no one important ever disappears so it doesnt
really matter does it  I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left and failing 
No one contradicted her No one offered a different answer 

I looked at Adrienne Mission accomplished Our routine insouciance had been disrupted The scales had
tipped Even when the conversation returned to lighter tones as it soon did I dwelt on Adriennes questions 
From the looks on my companions faces I knew they were thinking the same 

 How long have you been here 

The question previously posed to me was presented to the rest of our group excluding Ray Adrienne had
been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill recalling the last time the subject was
broached 

Sarah she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass  A long time Got to be months
and months at least 

 You were here before I was  said Kishori  and so was Tiffany 

I looked at Zheng he shrugged  Time passes in a weird way here I kept track for a while thirty eight
days but after that I guess I didn’t see the point 

Fact Some places are timeless 

 Why not  asked Adrienne 

 Days don’t matter  he said  The eleventh of a month or the seventeenth whether its Wednesday or Sunday 
summer back on Earth or winter it doesn’t affect us here 

Tiffany nodded but Kishori spoke before the other woman could  Why are you so interested  she asked
Adrienne 

Adrienne met her gaze  I don’t want to be here forever 

 But were not here forever  objected Sarah  Remember  Alexis left 

 Disappeared  I corrected her  We don’t know how or why he left Or where he went 

Zheng looked thoughtful He picked up his glass swirled the liquid around took a sip then set the glass
back down He glanced around at the rest of us  Do you want to leave  he asked  Could you live anywhere else
now 

I spoke up  Yes  I said  I would’nt  miss this much  No one else said anything I watched Adriennes
eyes move from one face to the next 

Zheng he addressed me again leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense steady gaze  You
think that  he said  but is it true  Would you be happy back in a normal life working and living and crying
in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days 

I didn’t answer 

Fact Its too easy to fall into patterns 

Fact I wasn’t sure I wanted the dream stage to end 

My quarters felt stifling Asphyxiating my mind I sat sideways in the armchair feet dangling over one arm 
neck resting against the other absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I
ruminated on the situation The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful I inspected the arrays of
entertainment options abstract old style flatscreens engrossing VR flicks and action games a selection of
quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity There was a schedule
advertising upcoming on ship events such as dance classes craft sessions and discussion groups and a list
of dinner invitations for me to respond to A menu of display options allowing me to customize all the
lightscreens superficial characteristics A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the
ship That was all 

A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms the ample closet space and the attached bathroom facility
had similarly provided no fodder Furniture dark wood expensive polished no secret compartments clothes 
leftover tray of half consumed food from the previous days lunch toiletries complete with miniature bottles
of sweet smelling apricot honey lotion lightscreen me 

I was discouraged and frustrated I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ships mystery just
as much as she did I wanted to find something anything that would prove all this was normal and sane I
didnt want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences 	

I wanted my contentment back 

I cornered Adrienne at dinner that night In one hand I balanced my plate of star shaped crackers globs of
elegant dips and garnishes little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale
green plant and an array of other delectable bite sized items My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a
small table against a wall She glared at me but obediently let me pull her along 

 Tell me  I said after we sat  what you have found  It wasn’t a question 

She gave me a grumpy look that informed me quite clearly of her current opinion of me  Not if youre
going to be rude about it 

I sighed  Sorry  I wasn’t not really but Id lie to get the conversation going  I want to know  I
explained in two brief sentences my earlier impasse 

 I don’t know much  she said still annoyed but at least cooperative She reviewed the information gleaned
from our previous dinner conversations adding  I heard the captain say something yesterday as I walking to
the Pyrope Parlor I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side talking to a couple
people and they must not have known I was there He said something about a wreck going well And listen when
they came round the corner Ray was with the captain 

The next time the captain stopped by our group Tiffany tagging along pretending that she too was a
social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone we were ready 

 Is there a doctor on board  asked Adrienne  Ive been having headaches  It was a lie but we needed
information 

Jefferson nodded  Down past the Emerald Lounge second door on the left All hours  A robot then Medical
AI were even more expensive than the barkeep I wondered how many people it treated Had anyone on the ship
ever fallen seriously ill 

 Does he age  asked Adrienne 

 The captain  I shrugged  I never thought about it 

Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face  That doesn’t answer my question  she said 

Adrienne only picked at her food 

 Not hungry  asked Kishori sympathetically 

 No  said Adrienne 

 At least have a drink  said Sarah  I find it takes the edge off 

 She doesn’t drink remember  said Kishori 

 Maybe that’s the problem  said Sarah 

 One hundred and forty seven is a magic number  said Sarah  You ever heard of Dunbar  Well weve got the
perfect size group right here  Just enough for us all to recognize each other Just enough for us all to be
able to barely avoid killing each other 

 Why doesn’t anyone mutiny  Adrienne asked  If you dislike this place so much why don’t you do something
about it 

 We cant  said Ray  What would we do 

Adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust  You could force the captain to set down somewhere Let
us off the ship If he refuses threaten him If he still refuses well of all of us isn’t there
someone who can drive a ship 

 Thats murder  objected Sarah 

 Thats survival  Adrienne corrected her  Do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your
life 

Sarah didn’t reply 

I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge looking out the windows at the stars 
Times like that running on less sleep than I should alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire
for the night I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it The stillness of
the room contributed as did the view Black and more black speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to
break the emptiness if only for a brief time All of it was temporary save for the black That was tonights
melodramatic theme the ephemeral nature of life Everything temporary Everything to fade away lost as dust
and scattered atoms between the stars and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born 

Thinking about that I wondered if Sarahs theory was right after all Some things in this world we have to
make them permanent ourselves And Jefferson he had done that He had made us a constant He made this
ship this life a constant The one thing that was known The one thing that would’nt  change 

Maybe everything we did all the stories we told maybe it was all lies Maybe wed never know each other 
not truly because we all hid behind the stories creating the realities we wanted to see But ultimately this
ship its purpose our purpose did it matter  We each had our own theory Maybe that was enough And all of us 
we were permanent characters in each others stories Maybe that made us more real Maybe it made us feel less
alone 

 Mind if I join you 

I turned to see Adrienne in the doorway She smiled then crossed the room to join me by the window not
waiting for an answer 

 Some nights  I said  I cant see the meaning in any of it All these things I do theyre just to pass
the time until I die 

Adrienne looked at me then back out through the window  You don’t see a meaning because there is no
meaning  she said 

After all of it as much as we feared being alone we feared being vulnerable even more Our instinct was to
hide 

 Look what I found  Adrienne said In her hands was a bottle 

And what happens to Adrienne 

I couldnt find her 

Jefferson was in the Captains Lounge 

Fact Sound is a vibration The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty eight degrees
Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty three meters per second or one thousand one hundred twenty five feet per
second 

 Up his dosage  I heard the captain say  Ive got a replacement lined up 

I ran 

I didn’t want to forget 

I didn’t want to be harvested 

The last thing I remember I was tearing down the corridors Life boats I thought Every ship had life
boats In case of emergency break glass Id find one Id put on a space suit Id get out of this ship Id
find civilization again A planet A space station Some other ship Any place but this place 

Failing all else Id suffocate Alone 

Ray he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls finding no glass to break  Relax  he told me 
sliding a needle into my arm  Itll pass  he told me He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing 

It passed 

This is my Hotel California 

I can never leave 




Tara stood stock still waiting for the first tiny gleam from the scout craft to
appear in the darkness of the wormhole The gentle constant breeze of recycled
air from the vent above blew an annoying hair against her nose but she ignored
it 

A gasp from the psychic broke her silent vigil and she turned 

 Results Harmon   she suppressed the surge of annoyance that ran through her as
she contemplated the psis gift of getting all the hot news first 

Harmons face slowly animated   joy sweeping in to replace stern concentration 
 Tarrin says the planets a freaking gemstone Thriving with life large and
small forms no buildings of any kind hydrocarbons metals and a stable
atmosphere he’s not even bringing them back through for a face to face
briefing He says we should come through now immediately before the probe is
reported late  

 Harmon tell that good for nothing son of a beta to get his hindquarters
through the gate and back here NOW or Ill open fire on him when we come back
through   Tara fumed Of all the impertinence Tarrin no doubt with orders from
Mason was questioning her command decisions that’s what I get for not using
mercenaries 

She returned to her watch regarding her own reflection in the long window 
Mahogany black curly hair cut short in the typical military style framed a
careworn dark skinned face It was not an attractive face right now her ebony
eyes shadowed by hours on the watch full lips pursed with frustration She had
the look of every leader she had ever known At six foot two she stood a full
head taller than even her Arrallin first officer Her glowering expression
completed the imposing effect She picked imaginary flecks off her stark gray
jumpsuit and snorted You look like hell Tar don’t blow this don’t let
fatigue get to you 

She used the discretion of the mirrored window to secretively survey her crew 
Harmon was an excellent addition to the bridge team but was she open minded
enough to defy United Earth Command and sever all ties from Earth  She watched
the psi bob her head unaware of the rest of the bridge shaking blonde curls as
she chattered away with the approaching psi relay on Masons ship She seemed so
depthless   self conscious and shallow on the outside but having that
incredible gift There had to be more to her 

Well if she didn’t pan out shed be terminated Any crew member that would
jeopardize the project was meat It would be a shame to lose that talent 
though 

Rakal her first officer was staring pensively at his panel He was what this
was all about She watched his graceful fingers ending in thick black claws tap
out calculations on the panel His pointed ears swiveled back and forth 
catching every sound from the bridge while his long tail swished to the rhythm
of his thoughts Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was
no common beta furry His silken fur which would be tawny golden and striped
with jet black bands was dyed perfectly to a pure black and his mane trimmed
and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat His eyes had
been treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden
yellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin and leader of his hive 
Right now he looked like an overgrown wolf whod learned touch typing 

The scout ship re emerged from the hole   a brilliant speck emerging from a
sphere of velvety blackness Its hail crackled across the comm and Tara spun
to retake her seat at the helm  Launch the second probe Wont Central be
crushed to learn that another gateway has yielded little more than a class F
planet and a white dwarf system Level and staffers should prepare to be
briefed and move out This sounds like its the one   The distinctive whuffle of
pleasure rippled through the betas on the bridge and Rakal let loose a small
growl as if to caution his charges against false hope Theyd scouted
twenty seven gates so far and none had turned up anything worth the
Insurrections time Tara would not let giddy hopes drag them onto a rock that
would spell the end for the project and the Arrallin species

 Strange things have always happened to my family It came in through my mothers blood my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories bylichkas of ancestors with the  second sight  stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times When I asked her if shed ever seen them   before I was old enough to stop believing I mean   she would always look sad and tell me  No not since the family came to America has anything happened to us But if you ever should see a faerie tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly   As I got older I shook the tales off with a nod and a  Yes Nana  
 I got older and went to school then to college and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school Sometimes wed get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges and wed rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up Boston is a strange place at night You would’nt  believe half of the shit i’ve seen even when I was straight 
 It was a Friday night Rachel and I went out to dinner and when we finished she saw that there was a message on her cell phone She checked it there in the restaurant Her head tilted into the phone as she listened her pleather purse on her lap shining jet against the worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance T shirt  Its from Mitch  she said folding up the phone  He says we should meet him tonight theres a good one going on in that church that closed down last month 
  I don’t know   it was going to be just us tonight i’m not sure i’m up for a night out  I was feeling calm and private that night It seemed like tonights darkness was small and personal cupped hands offering a place for two not the burning open darkness of a rave 
  Baby let’s go Its been over a week and I want to dance let’s go together you know youll have fun once you get into it  She bit the inside of her bottom lip looking at me like I was breaking her poor sweet heart i’m a sucker for that and she knows it 
  Okay Rachel let’s go you’re probably right 
 She grinned and gave me a kiss across the table her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing not just pressing your face into someone elses 
  Lets not get fucked up tonight though okay Rache  We don’t   
  Sure babe Come on I don’t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself let’s not waste any more time  She stood up and I followed her out to the street It was dark enough that I could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light Without hearing the car horns I could almost taste the air of late March through the street fumes If it was March that meant that wed been together almost a year and a half It was last February after the winter break that we moved in together Now spring was back under the concrete and I could smell it even here 
  Isnt it an amazing night Rache  Even the city feels alive when spring comes 
  Taxi  She waved down a car and pulled me in In a few minutes we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church After she paid the driver she grabbed my arm laughing and we ran down the street I heard the pulse already We slammed against the doorway and I was laughing too the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest Rachel in my arms because shed used me to soften her landing We kissed and slipped inside 
 The old vaulted church was stripped down there was no cloth on the altar just a DJs toolkit and his beer Through the dark I could see three bolts left in the wall from where theyd taken down the crucifix A confessional too beaten up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside and where the pews had been taken out a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJs moving sermon 
 Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceilings blue lit shadowed vault and the light catching haze from who knows what rising between the DJ and the crowd There was a terrific echo each beat reverberating inside of the next and the old stained glass windows rattled in their frames On the dance floor people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air 
 I danced with Rachel for a while but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd 
 When she hadnt come back halfway through the next song I glanced over at the bar It was just a little set up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share mostly beer Rachel was standing with a plastic cup looking like she was having a conversation but I couldnt see anyone else there The next time the crowd split I saw him He stood in front of a blue light so I couldnt see him clearly but what I saw was memorable He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet and his hair gleamed black against his white skin The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor setting off his striking face without illuminating its details and his wrists flashed white in the darkness He didn’t move just stared and held his drink 
 The next time I saw them his mouth was moving She nodded and he took her arm I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong 
 Saturday morning I woke up and saw that she still hadnt come home I called Mitch and our other friends hoping that shed crashed at one of their houses but I had no luck A couple of them remembered seeing her leave but none of them had seen the thin man with her I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features even in that distorting light 
 I caught a taxi back to the church It was still a mess but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared I walked across what had been the dance floor The church was completely different now sunlight fell through the stained glass catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry healthy warmth into the edges of the room through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up   which if she were in a situation where I should be doing something would probably be never 
 Standing in the center of the church I took out my cell phone and called the police  I need to file a missing persons report  Rachel Frieze Last night walking on West nd street around   maybe eleven or twelve oclock What   But sir this is an unusual situation She didn’t come home last night none of her friends have seen her  Sir if she’s in any danger it will probably be too late to help her by that time My girlfriend has disappeared I don’t even know where to start looking and I need help  Yes sir I understand  The police would’nt  file a report for someone whod been missing overnight I closed the phone 
 Walking out of the church a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise A cold front must have hit while I was inside Glancing down the street I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran I pulled my T shirts sleeves down my arms as far as theyd go but I wasn’t ready for cold 
 Walking didn’t build up much heat it just moved the air enough to chill me more After Id walked about a block a car rolled up behind me It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it 
 I heard an automatic window roll down  Hey  said a male voice  do you need some help 
 I turned around The man looked over forty and he was driving a car Id be afraid to drive on this street  Its a long way to anywhere worth going  he said  Would you like some help 
  Ah I think i’m fine thanks  I told him and turned back to the sidewalk 
  Really Id like to help Please hop in You don’t look dressed for this weather 
 I glanced back over my shoulder  No thanks sir i’m just fine Really don’t worry about me 
  Nathan Spencer I offer you help I advise that you not refuse me a third time 
 I stopped and looked back at him surprised He met my eyes coolly  How do you know my name 
  I know your family Get in We have a lot of work ahead of us and its best to start now 
 I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat Before I had my belt on we were rolling forward  Okay  I said  Im in the car Now will you tell me how you know my family and how you happened to be driving by just now  In fact why didn’t you call me by name the first time  And how did you recognize me when   
  Thats enough I can only answer one question at a time I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours I am here now because you called for help and no one else would answer  He turned onto the next street and shifted up  I will help you find your Rachel I have to warn you though you wont like what I have to tell you 
 I shivered Something in his tone couldnt be disbelieved  Tell me anyway If she’s in trouble I want to find her wherever she is 
 My driver took a deep breath As he did his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines like wrinkles running across the sides of his neck  Nathan  he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation  Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet This person like me is not a member of traditional society You see Nathan there is  separate from your society  oh damn it i’ve never had to give this conversation before Come on I have something to show you  With that he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadnt noticed before We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldnt tell whether they were abandoned My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year 
 In front of a few houses there were cars parked but there were almost none on the streets Their bumpers looked ready to drop off and their paint was half smog I got a strange feeling that we werent supposed to be driving here  Hey  I said  are you sure that we should be going this way  I mean    
  Just ignore that  he told me  Youll be used to the sensation in a moment  That just unnerved me more As we kept driving the anxiety grew more pronounced I noticed that there were some people on the street people the same color as the soiled buildings Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes  Okay this is the spot  said my driver pulling over He parked and got out 
  Is it really safe to leave the car   he was already walking toward the squat brick windowed building we were parked next to Glancing back at that gleaming glare I decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car I hopped out ran after him and reached him just as he was knocking on the door Someone opened it a crack then ushered us in 
 Inside the building opened up The ceiling was high and wooden and I could see part of a DJs booth down the hall It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub Then I looked down and saw what had let us in  Nepthys my man What up  The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap  Nice my man  he said as they clasped hands  Whos the freak 
  This is someone from Ivans family Did I ever tell you about them 
  Yeah one time man but you were pretty fucked up Whats your problem kid 
 The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach His skin was brown and stretched like some diseased saplings bark It pulled back around his fingertips which bore things that might have been nails or claws When he grinned I saw that his teeth were sharp and small like a hunting cats Under matted hair his eyes had slit pupils 
 Nepthys quickly answered for me  Girlfriend troubles She came down here with someone after a party and I don’t think it was one of your average pixies 
  Bummer So whats the cat look like 
 He turned to me Nepthys nodded  Its okay you can trust him that’s why we came here 
 It was easier to talk than to question  I  I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel He was standing right in front of some blue lights so I couldnt see him very well but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly He was slim almost drawn but he had a kind of   luster to him I guess He wasn’t a person youd describe with normal adjectives you know 
 They nodded  Oh totally  said the hunchback  I get that all the time around here 
  He was wearing a sort of jacket  maybe blue velvet I couldnt tell in the dark but it had ruffles at the throat things like that He really stood out that’s why I couldnt understand why no one else remembered him He had some rings too I remember that he hardly ever moved just stared at Rachel Even when he talked he hardly opened his mouth I don’t know how he couldve been heard over the music 
 The two glanced at each other  What do you think  asked the hunchback 
  Ive looked into it a little and I do think we might be dealing with one of them Have you seen anyone like that in your club 
  Not that I can remember man I can send you to a guy who knows all about them though If this cats for real I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know 
  Youre a wonder Dvorov We should head straight over It wont be long before nightfall 
  Oh yeah man Here let me write down how to find him  The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail then handed it to Nepthys  Here you go man Good luck 
  Thanks Dvorov I owe you one let’s go  That last one was to me I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left He gave me a half hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing and whether I should be wearing body armor 
 Back on the street I began to see things that I had never looked for until then Still in my initial shock I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadnt registered when we parked I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through   people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog it had a leeching heavy dimness I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light A corpulent batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle Leaning from the rough hewn window of one building on our right was something with long green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill Thirty five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards 
  We and thousands like us have been living separately as long as there has been a human society  said my driver I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills  We interact with humans take advantage of them grant them boons sometimes even become their friends but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction At this point we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional 
  The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours Love ins raves gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over and that is where Rachel met someone from this world Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this where the human population is so overwhelming that they wont be noticed in the right corner with the right protective spells 
 He took out the hunchbacks directions and glanced at an alley behind us  Okay Nathan We should get started right away Theres no time to waste  
 He saw that I wasn’t moving Setting an arm on my shoulder he said  Nathan what you see here might be frightening but those things you saw are people just like you Theyll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms 
  Thanks Its very reassuring that Ill not only be an outsider but a curiosity 
  Nathan you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel Well she’s here and she needs your help Now the more we can do before nightfall the better 
  But why are you even helping me  Until thirty seconds ago I didn’t believe in magic or any of that kind of  weirdness  
  Nathan I told you my family owes yours a debt In this world ones word is a promise Now can we get going 
 I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye  Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name 
  Youve got a deal let’s go 
 As we headed down the sidewalk I said  What is your name anyway 
  Thats a question you learn not to ask here What you may call me is Nepthys 
 Holding Dvorovs directions Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway I started wondering again how reliable my guides credentials were Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other he did not inspire confidence 
  Just at this corner  he said interrupting my immanent panic attack  were going to stop and turn three times widdersh   er counterclockwise then face east East is that way  He pointed at the wall to our right  Dont let the sun fool you Then i’m going to shed a little blood but don’t worry none of yours  I blinked at him but he just kept walking until we reached the corner  Okay you might feel silly but just turn three times to your left Try to keep in time with me  We spun around three times and then something flashed across Nepthys hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground and I jumped back When it had all burnt a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it opening the door  Are you coming 
 We slipped through the door and came out not inside the building but on a busy street in a completely different part of town The sky cupping over squat buildings was less yellow here and stands were set up everywhere the way Id picture a market in the Middle East Nepthys took us immediately to the right where he led us to a cart filled with herbs Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon rosemary and scents I couldnt place The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland it had the same opium dream wise man quality Id always given the caterpillar Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart and with its long many shouldered pole of a torso it rose over our heads even while seated Its face was small and wrinkled with penny sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose  Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs  it asked  There are no finer to spice a meal nor purer to mix a potion Please let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs 
  Were not here to browse  Nepthys told him  Wed like to see a man about some garlic 
 The thing frowned  We have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart gentle sir If   
  You know what I mean Please if we could see him we would be much obliged I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons 
 It hissed thoughtfully  True true Step behind the cart and enter through the door there using your left hand to open the door and your right    he looked at me     to close it 
  Thank you  Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart 
 The latch opened under Nepthys left hand with a clack The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs At the top was one door We entered 
 The room held a bed a bookcase and a desk with one chair Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls On the bed was a small ratty man I smelled matted hair and cedar chips He opened one eye when we came in but did not move 
  Were here for information about a vampire  said Nepthys 
  Oh shit  I said 
  Sorry kid  Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual 
  Wait Nepthys   you said nothing about vampires Frankly I don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire Theres an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are Are  look are they as bad as people in my world think they are 
  I don’t know Theyre almost as rare here and i’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire 
  Only unsuccessfully right 
  No those people don’t usually leave stories 
  Oh thanks Nepthys for your confidence inspiring tales of experience So theyre probably worse than we think okay that’s great Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel 
  My plan is that you shut up while were trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what were actually going up against Okay  don’t forget she’s your girlfriend Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman I can hear your heartbeat from over here 
 I shut up and tried to breathe Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed who had not moved  Please accept our apologies As you can see our situation is of personal importance to the young man Now may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire  It would be a great help to us 
 The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden rooms tight air Finally in a pinched rasp he said  My information is purely for the purposes of a collector I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm 
  Sir we simply want to discover whether this individual is in fact a vampire If there is any boon that you would have us do in return we would be glad to do it 
 He continued to lie in place still breathing heavily I tried to keep myself calm Then with a sigh he said  I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed It would allow me to leave this bed despite my current illness My problem is that it was not made in this realm but by a human and only a human may handle it The herb vendor will tell you where you can find it If you would fetch me this stone I would tell you what I can 
  Of course we will fetch you the stone  Nepthys assured him  You have our thanks 
 Outside the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone He told Nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street and we set off 
 When we reached the street I expected some sort of temple or a row of antiquaries or at least a sleazy black market relics merchant Instead it looked like we were in the red light district women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted like a saint under G ds light and handcuffed 
 Inside the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive A large woman similarly decorated quickly drifted up to us 
  Good evening gentlemen  she said  May I invite you to have a cup of tea 
  No thank you  said Nepthys  we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer Are you the proprietor of this shop 
  Yes  answered the woman  I am Madame Entera at your service How can I help you gentlemen 
  We are here to see about a certain stone 
 She raised an eyebrow  Are you  Well we don’t get many customers asking about that item Please walk this way 
 She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd floppy hats on the other After this we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside 
  Excuse me  I said ignoring Nepthys warning look  but may I ask what is kept in these rooms 
 The woman laughed  Why the merchandise of course  she said 
 Nepthys leaned close to my ear  This is a slave shop  he explained quietly 
 The woman paused before another door this one not barred but locked As she brought out the key she said  We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items Weve had genies indentured sorcerers even golems and the occasional elf This is one of the stranger items though Its been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it If we only had a human on our staff we could have done so ages ago and sold it off but we have no such luck  She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room  Here it is  she said 
 With a flourish she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire intricate patterns like a Czars jewelry box crawling down the walls In its center under a spearing white light was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth on which lay a gray plum sized rock 
  A marvel isn’t it  she said  That such a rock could hold so much magic   its a wonder 
  That it is  Nepthys assured her  What would convince you to part with it 
 She considered this looking him over  You would’nt  give me the human would you  No  she said seeing his expression  that would make the stone rather useless  Nevertheless she gave me what I can only describe as an  appraising glance I have never felt so appraised in all my life  He looks healthy  she said  how about a pint of his blood 
  A pint  Madame I have his health to consider 
  Half a pint then   and his hair 
 Nepthys turned to me  Well kid what do you think  Remember this is your quest i’m not giving my blood 
  As if I wanted it  interrupted the woman 
  I think its a fair deal considering the return  he told me  but its up to you 
 I thought about it then nodded 
  Marvelous  cried the woman  One half pint of human blood willingly given and his fine head of hair for the stone  
 She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping There was a wooden chair where she sat me down and asked me to wait Soon she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl which she put on the table beside me  Roll up your sleeves  she told me She opened the bowl and carefully gingerly brought out a fat dripping leech It must have been larger than my finger She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin I thought that I could feel a slight itching 
  They take about a quarter pint each  said Madame Entera drawing out another skinny leech  Theyre quick too Well be done with them before your hair is finished  Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber 
 Half an hour later I left the room pale and bald running my fingers over my scalp At least the barber hadnt nicked me Madame Entera took me back up to the stones room where Nepthys was waiting by the door  Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it  the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him  Thank you for doing business at our house and I hope to see you again 
 I left not a little unnerved and still woozy from the leeches  Come on  said Nepthys  you could use a drink 
 We hit a bar on the next street over  Vodka straight up  Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter  and a Bloody Mary for my friend Make it extra bloody  When our drinks came he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary  That should help  he said  You could run on empty with a little of that stuff It wont refill your blood supply but while that’s in your system you wont even need blood  He grinned at me  Drink up kid 
 I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery Nepthys slapped me on the back  Okay  I said  now that were sitting down can you explain a little more of whats going on here  I mean what is this place really 
 He thought about that  I think that our world is a reflection of yours or yours is a more boring reflection of ours This place is just a little of both In America things are still weird after the European conquest The natives are still here but so is everyone else The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities We arent quite what youd expect from reading the Grimms 
  What do you mean 
  Okay take elves  He caught the bartenders eye for another shot  You figure theyre some Lincoln green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory right  Not in America Here theyre the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the gritty ambience   you have them in your world too right  Except its worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of societys lowest rungs Some of them actually commit to this society though Theres an amazing DJ whos an elf He has a real ear for it When they do decide to do something for real theyre always the best at it  He downed the second shot  I am glad to be out of the favor trading scene for half a minute Its exhausting to talk to those people One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something So what else do you want to know Nathan 
  I don’t know  hey what about the nature spirits things like that  I mean where do the dryads fit in a place like this 
  If the tree isn’t around the dryad isn’t around Its as simple as that 
 That made me a little sad They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school  Well what about you  How did you get to America 
  My parents came over from Russia just like your family My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate but we don’t toss those around in this place They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary When the Russian government dammed the river my parents decided that instead of dying with the river they would stick with the people of the village theyd protected I was born here and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river Sure I miss having a place to settle down but its better than waiting to get dammed  He took another shot of vodka 
  Shouldnt you be going light on the vodka  I mean we might have a lot of work ahead of us 
  Are you kidding  I can drink like a fish kid We should get going though Still woozy  I nodded  A little walking should get the stuff into your system Come on let’s go 
 As we left the bar I asked to see the rock  Why  Nepthys asked 
  Im just curious I want to see what a magic stone looks like don’t worry Ill be careful not to touch it 
 He thought about it then handed me the pouch I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside It looked like a normal river stone a gray oval with a white stripe through it As long as I looked at it it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow 
 Suddenly what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me I almost tripped over him and the stone went flying out of the pouch Nepthys tried to grab it but by reflex I caught it first 
 Immediately I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid  Nathan  said Nepthys  I think that you just did something very stupid 
  I agree  I told him The stone was as warm as human flesh now and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stones soft heat I don’t know Then there was light a kind of rosy glow and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air The air around me seemed to still sound and light came in around the corners of my eyes  Do you know what this thing does  I shouted hardly able to hear myself 
 Nepthys was saying something that looked like  I have no idea  but I couldnt hear him The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in converging on the rosy glow around the stone and for a moment I was blind Then I opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street There was no sign of the stone 
  I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop  said Nepthys The girl was as soft and rosy as the stones glow and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles and soft white leather boots held her feet 
 When she didn’t move I knelt down and put a hand to her brow As soon as I touched her her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist I couldnt move 
  Name me  she said 
 I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation but Nepthys stopped me  Dont name her What did you say  okay  The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what shell respond to until we figure out how to put her back 
 I was at a loss Id never named anyone before I thought back to one time when Id been thinking about raising a family and remembered that Id always liked the name   
  Amy 
 Nepthys looked at me incredulously  You awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer and you name her Amy  Amy smiled at me and let go of my arm but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss 
 I stood up and Amy stood with me  So  back to our garlicky friend 
  I suppose so  said Nepthys  and youd better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he wont care we woke her up 
 We walked back to the herb stand The vendor stared a little at Amy his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stands little lamp but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs 
 When Nepthys opened the little mans door he rolled over and grinned to see us but when Amy walked in he blanched  What  he screamed  You idiots You woke it up  Get out of my sight this instant 
  But  but sir  I said  are you sure she’s no help to you 
  Not if you named it already you ninny and i’m sure that you have Fools Get out of my sight now   unless you know how to put it back   I thought as much Now leave before I call the rats on you 
 We left Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck  You idiot  he hissed  do you know how much youve set us back  I should say set yourself back since its your girlfriend were looking for  I thought about Rachel in the excitement I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts  Youre just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact Come on were heading out  He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs Walking outside I was shocked to see that it was already dark  Night comes quickly here  said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me  Didnt I warn you 
  Okay  he said as we hit the street  were going to see another friend of mine First though we are getting you a hat You look ridiculous with a shaved head  At a nearby stand he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston It was a black baseball cap that read  Dead Can Dance in gold across the front Amy liked it I think She still hadnt spoken since I named her so I wasn’t sure 
 He took us to a squat long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal The black door opened as we came up to it and a pale man opened the door He was naked but there was nothing to hide his body was hairless and completely smooth I only say  he because he didn’t have a hint of femininity His eyes were white From behind him I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cures  A Forest 
  Im here to see Isis Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her 
 The man closed his eyes A moment later he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up taking Amys small hand so that she would’nt  lag behind I shivered as I walked past the pale mans blank eyes wondering what they were staring at Amy gave my hand a squeeze 
 Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the buildings façade a vaulted ribbed intestine of a hallway whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic I thought that I saw one rib shift in its setting like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall but when I turned it was still 
 Then there was a door which opened as we approached Inside the space opened into a wide square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size In the center was a dais covered with white furs and a young woman surrounded by more pale men These were incontestably male 
  Nepthys  said the woman slithering up across the furs to sit up As she rose her robes fell open and I realized that except for what looked like a red silk kimono she was naked   naked and stunning I had an urge to cover Amys eyes  Its been years since i’ve seen you Please come and sit beside me and introduce your friends 
  This man is here in search of his lover who was stolen from him in the human world  said Nepthys ushering us toward the woman in silk  The girl is  surprising  he concluded 
  And I am Isis  said the woman offering her hand to me I took it and dropping to one knee gave her fingers a small kiss It seemed appropriate  It is an honor to meet you Lady Isis  I said 
 She laughed liquid alluring alarming  Oh precious He has lovely manners Nepthys despite his poor taste in hats You may leave out the Lady boy I don’t wish to be reminded of how old I actually am  A wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes  Now how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge  I hope I can start by offering some wine 
 Nepthys poured out wine for three of us  May I have a little more of what you gave me before Nepthys  I asked  I still feel a little woozy  He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me The wines rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth 
 Isis nostrils twitched slightly  Youve lost blood boy  This story might be interesting Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved 
  It was part of the price for this girl who was a rock at the time  explained Nepthys 
  I have a feeling that she was worth the trade  I added Amy still holding my hand smiled 
  She may be at that  said Isis gazing at her  That sweet small nose and her soft lips   shed kiss well I should think if gently She has good blood under her cheeks Good round breasts too even though theyre small they suit her  Amy didn’t blush and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying 
  She would have been worth it  Nepthys interrupted  if this fool hadnt accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact He was going to give us valuable information for her 
  Now I understand why you’re here  said Isis  So what do you need to know 
  You know I would’nt  come to you if I could get this information another way  said Nepthys apologetically 
  Mmm  she replied I couldnt tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant 
  I think that the person who stole the girl were looking for might be a vampire Isis  you know some way to locate the undead don’t you 
  I do Describe this one to me If I know him I can find him If not youll have to bring me something to work with 
 Nepthys looked at me I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin his dark hair the way that light seemed to flow around him as best as I could Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full hanging breasts When I had told her all that I could remember she blinked her black lashes and said  I remember him 
  You do  Nepthys could hardly believe her  Thats amazing 
  It is I would have sworn to you that he was dead He should be I hope that you can do a better job than the last lot  She sat up running her hands along her pale round thighs  All right then Let me see if I can find him 
 Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands A dark glow coalesced around her palms Amy leaned forward looking amazed The glow reflected on her pink face casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat strong cheeks Tiny drops of blood began to seep out of Isis palms as her brow creased Her candy lips twisted into a frown The dark glow grew stronger and larger filling the air for about a foot around her hands In her palms the droplets of blood swelled into small pools 
 The dark glow began to flicker and Isis frown of concentration became one of worry The pools in her hands grew deeper She didn’t shed a bead of sweat and I didn’t even see her draw a breath but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake The blood in her palms still filling up began to ripple Shivers swept through her body and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him He glanced at me with honest concern probably the first honest moment hed shown me Is she all right  I didn’t know 
 Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs She gasped and the dark glow went out taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam Isis collapsed on the fur strings cut 
 Now Nepthys lunged forward took her by the arms  Isis what happened  Are you hurt 
 She shook her head rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something  What did you say  asked Nepthys 
 She rolled onto her back her arms crossed tightly over her chest For the first time she looked vulnerable When she finally spoke I had to lean close to hear her  I found your vampire  she said  but he might know that someones looking for him he’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden You should look for him at Dvorovs as quickly as you can  She turned to me with tired sympathy  I didn’t see a girl with him Hurry though and you might find him before he leaves  A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants  One of these will lead you out 
 I stood and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her He stood to go but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment I turned back to the door  Come on Amy  I said  hell be along soon 
 Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall When we got there another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood He offered it to Nepthys who opened the box on velvet lining a wooden hammer and two stakes 
  Mountain ash  said Nepthys  That was very kind of her  Closing the box he paused beside the open door and looked back at me  I really hope we find your Rachel  he said It looked like he was going to continue but then he walked out the door 
  I know a quick way to Dvorovs  said Nepthys  I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me  In a few minutes we were back to the first door wed knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart 
  Yo my man Nep You got the sucker already 
  No but we got a tip that he might be in your club Have you seen him 
  Here man  you’re crazy I havent had a vampire here since you and    Nepthys shot a wicked look at him  Anyway long time man 
  Thats odd Do you mind if we check it out anyway  I have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere 
 Dvorov glanced over his shoulder a little nervous  I guess man but be quick I don’t want my customers thinkin that anythings wrong you know 
  Of course Well be in and out in a minute  Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor 
  So did you get anything out of the guy I sent you to  Dvorov asked us 
  No he said that his research was purely academic not for hunters 
  Bummer I guess I probably shouldve known though I mean he is kinda tight about that stuff  He didn’t look very surprised  Anyway this is the dance floor man Good luck 
 Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking 
 I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me pressing me into the wall but I took a breath and kept moving My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat The music began to build and a strobe came on Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing   for a second I was back with my family in Russia hiding from the cold Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me I gathered her under my arm Dvorov was somewhere behind me too negotiating delicately through his patrons 
 Just in front of me a massive thing slammed into the wall sending up a cloud of granite dust It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf Its haunches twitched in time to the music As it started to rise a man with thick scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor 
 Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this I wasn’t sure that I could survive the crush of the crowd A cold thing with countless writhing tentacles fell against me thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose tripping me and clutching at my limbs A woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing Then a looming shape to my right fell away and I saw him in a flash of the strobe his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd The creature blocking my vision moved back but I had seen all that I needed to see 
 A bleeding eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me but I ducked around it and toward the bar I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before a mountain of wet veined flesh and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm 
 It was Dvorov He pulled my ear down to his mouth  You seen enough man  he shouted 
  Yes  I called back  I saw him he’s sitting right there at the bar 
 Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd but it had shifted again and we couldnt see a thing  I don’t think he’s there  Dvorov shouted to me  It must have been wishful thinking 
  No I saw him I have to hurry too Who knows how long hell stick around 
  Listen man he’s not there i’m telling you its not even worth checking the bar  I turned to keep going but he caught my arm again  Dont do this kid Its a dumb idea Even if you did find this vampire cat hed tear you apart If he got your girl she’s probably dead  I shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs getting almost to the edge of the dance floor 
 Suddenly Amy screamed I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away His eyes were glowing red and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off The dancers near us tried to clear some space He shot back up hardly touching the ground and I kicked him back He jumped at my arm while I was still off balance and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that its too late to save itself 
 A heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up On the floor was Dvorovs head separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand It flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with Dvorovs blood 
  He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two  he said by way of explanation  You spotted our boy didn’t you  I bet his hide out is nearby too let’s hurry  He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip The crowd parted for us 
 The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us In a blink of the strobe light he was on his feet and dashing from the room  Come on  shouted Nepthys 
 We chased after him Amy keeping up valiantly behind us He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall and we chased up after him heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held Luckily the vampire turned off after three stories He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room then made a turn out of sight 
 When I came to the door at the end of the room it looked like it had been torn off its hinges I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him 
 A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral The vault rose into obscurity above me and a massive rose window stood ahead of me The panes looked dyed black and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere I couldnt tell how many people were running much less where they were On the steps in front of the altar I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women Then I heard Nepthys shout  Nathan Behind you  I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head leaping like a panther He smashed into the pews behind me and I heard him leap across the rest of the row There was Nepthys on the other side of the pews holding the wooden box in his hand He tossed it to me and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again turning to face me 
 I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes He leapt over the pews soaring like a grasshopper and drew a gleaming knife in midair I dodged but he tossed it and I held the box in front of my face The blade lodged in the wood its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin My arms shook from the force of his throw Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand His first move pulled out the dagger almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer ready to drive the ash spike into his heart Behind him I saw Nepthys running between the pews I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me I raised the stake he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine The stake went down there was a blur and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw 
 Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant then all went numb Taste hearing and touch became a single blur and I do not know if my eyes were open My mind began to dissipate but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said  This ones blood isn’t worth drinking  Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack 
 I must have fallen to the floor then I could perceive Nepthys sword flashing over me and I heard steel crack then bone I thought I heard Rachels voice blearily calling for me Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar 
 I was content to let myself drift away and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedrals hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek A girls voice soft and almost recognizable spoke  Nathan  I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake 
 I stood and turned toward the altar The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me I stepped up behind him and raised my hands which almost seemed to be glowing Then the stake came down into his back and one two three strikes with the hammer drove it in The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth 
 Behind me Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug I pulled the vial of liquid that hed been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar 
 Rachel her clothes torn and her face drawn looked like she might cry when she saw me I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me  My fuckin hero  she whispered 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 The Black Willow
 
 Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close Opening a side drawer he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot After filling his pen Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desks right hand corner His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lanterns struggling glow The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds casting its bone pale glow onto the pine floorboards 
 Allan unfolded another page this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right The lines of letters stepped into their divisions in the shape of a storys outline the loose dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet awaiting tendons muscle and blushing skin Allan reviewed the troops all prepared to disembark their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to be thus upsetting the apple cart of his lifes plan clarified   of course   by his very time away from her he loved best 
 Although the concept was a simple one Allan thought it had potential Besides the public liked a good simple romance Perhaps this will be more saleable he thought and began to write 
 
 They gazed at each other lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before  What about Roger   she asked knowing that the answer no longer mattered 
 
 This is good he thought pausing to raise the low light of the lantern i’m almost done and the happy ending is just falling into place I hardly dare to think it but   I may finish this story 
 As he thought this a sinuous wind encircled the house slipping through the walls to chill him The papers and the lanterns flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allans window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door This was no stranger however the twisted ancient thing was older than Allan its branches rapping on his window since his childhood Its thin drawn fingers framed the bloated moon whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly The great jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author who gazed up through his windows tiny frame with trepidation Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him His pen flickered forth words dancing out from its nib In the authors eye gleamed the lanterns reflection   or was it a reflection  For while the lanterns spark shivered in the chill breeze this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owners pen scratching out the rhythm of the willows fingers 
 
 The frenzied writing ceased at last the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort He held a hand to his forehead eyes closed and face flushed I did it again he thought After all that   so near the end to lose control again His breath returning to its normal rhythms he dared to look at the page before him 
 His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears he draped his loose cape over her shoulders  Come darling   he whispered  Where I am to take you one need never think of those left behind   
 They stepped together into his carriage her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt conveyed as if through her skin the unearthly nature of the rails and reins the wheelspokes They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting For a few yards they kicked up dust along the roadway then they raised their hooves and took to the air She gaped afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand The New England woods disappeared even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky Above them the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the skys glory 
 
 Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window  Damn you   he cried  will you never leave me be  Shall I never finish a story in peace   He pounded his desk in vain cursing the foul muse that drove him 
 
 The next day Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well furnished parlor Taking a measured sip of white wine from his crystal glass he glanced at his host   a cultured man dressed in a light suit of the current fashion and wearing his pale hair with a heavy set of sideburns   who passed him a silver tray 
  Cucumber sandwich  
 Allan took a sandwich between his fingers  Thank you Arthur  
 Arthur replaced the tray onto the lacquered cherry table that stood in the center of his ordered chamber In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial he refilled their glasses  How is the writing these days my dear Mr Clemm  
  Perfectly dreadful my dear Mr Mason   Allan sighed  I had a perfect story in my pages my hero returned home and reclaimed his love I nearly had it tied together before  
  Before  
  Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe   though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others thank Heaven  
 Arthurs face assumed a long suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation  Im not familiar with Mr Poes works but I assume you’re referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic  
  Its far from a penchant Arthur This is more like a compulsion a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment then leaps and takes ahold of me screaming out through my quill  
  How perfectly awful   Arthur grimaced at the vivid description  Im sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption  
  I know   Allan replied  but how am I to do that  You know I do not wish to make my stories thus but it is my nemesis confronting me anew at every turn  
 Arthur raised a critical brow  Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal and believe me Allan you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish There simply is no audience for fairy tales   no literate audience at least  
  It is true   Allan admitted fidgeting with his cufflinks  that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher i’ve even tried rewriting the corrupted sections but once my characters have gone down that road nothing can recall their former life My prodigal ink blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road  
 Arthur sighed and sipped his wine  If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours you might write something really worth reading Its hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd  
 Allan hung his head holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night and his clothing had a rumpled look as if by mere proximity it had taken on the aspect of his weariness He scratched the back of his dark haloed head and blinked bleary eyes  I would drive it out   he said softly  but I fear for what would remain  
  Perhaps you require a rest from writing   suggested Arthur  You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat improve your disposition  
  Perhaps it would   Allan replied rising and vainly straightening his suit  I shall consider it in the meantime however I must be off You have been a gracious host as always  
 Arthur rose and shook his hand  So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home   he said  I hope soon to see you in better sorts  
 They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthurs gate He walked the wheel ruts hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust Some quarter mile from Arthurs gate he halted confronted by a halloo  Nathan   he called out to the empty road 
 The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree  I had a hunch youd be at Arthurs today   said Nathan  so I thought Id wait here for you   Nathans lanky frame dressed in a loose tan jacket fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface infusing his body with a rakish energy  So Allan   said Nathan unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside  how goes life for the quintessential American author   
  I would’nt  know   replied Allan dryly before continuing in another tone entirely  I destroyed another story last night Nathan  
 Leaning against his tree Nathan shook his head  You mean finished another story  
  Yes it is finished Ended Never again shall it see the rosy fingered dawn Nathan youve read these abominations of mine You know just as well as I that they have no future no potential At best they are faery tales at worst expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see  
  So instead you would write   what  
  Something saleable something worth reading worth writing I want to write as others do a tale set in our real world of characters who might live therein not citizens of some airy demesne beyond the stars  
  Why is that more desirable than what you write today  
  People will read such stories they are worth publishing  
  If you never finish such stories how can they be worth publishing  
  That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct  
  Why do you write  
   Why   to earn a living I suppose Why do you ask  
  You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter though you face such difficulty Why is that  
  I suppose it is because I enjoy my craft I would not be happy thus separated from it  
  So at its heart then your writing   as opposed to working otherwise   is for yourself  
  Yes I suppose one could see it thus But really Nathan your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level  
 Ignoring the statement Nathan continued  Your writing is for you Allan not for the publishers or some imagined audience Since you seem unable to write normally why not embrace your tales as they are leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure  Your stories strike a chord with the deepest most ancient stories of mankind the tales basic to humanity Tell them and they will create an audience You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are speak and they shall listen  
 
 Allan crouched over his desk once more pen in hand and mind blank He contemplated a story an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago He had filled his pen and raised it the nib descending towards the paper before the sound came the gentle persistent tapping of the gnarled primeval willow touching the window with long insistent fingers 
 His eyes awoke with a passionate determined flame though the only light came from the glutted moon Allan filled page after page the words escaping from his mind onto the paper Where before they had marched in regiments practiced in ranks and followed their leaders commands the words now escaped in their true forms unhindered by any stricture He continued long into the night until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow raised perpetually skyward 
 
 Arthur looked up from the results of a nights frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye 
  What is this   he queried indicating the pages he held in his left hand 
  I decided that  since I wasn’t having much success with more   traditional   stories I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely   Allan replied somewhat less self assured than he had been the previous night 
  What in G ds name could have possessed you to do such a thing   cried Arthur nearly raising his voice  After all I said the day before why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self indulgent fantasy   He shook the papers at Allan raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son  This is nothing but a glorified Grimms tale a miscarried child of Stoker a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant   He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthurs throat  Do you hate the modern system of literature  Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare   
 For a moment Allan could hardly do more than shake his head  No of course not  I   
  Then why   Arthur barreled on  do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble this morbid paganistic drivel  Why do you disregard my warnings my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption this literary debauchery   He glared at Allan eyes impaling him and demanding a response 
  Could you write decent tales with that willow at your window   Allan cried out at last stepping forward and casting his arms open confronting Arthur with this demanding pleading interrogation  Its twigs rap constantly against the wall the wind always demanding my attention How could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door  
 Arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was Arthur Mason  A tree  A tree forced you to write this my dear Mr Clemm  I must admit this seems far fetched even by your standards   even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you  
  You don’t know what this is like   said Allan shaking his head  Nathan would understand completely   Even as he said it Allan prayed that his statement was true 
  Very well   said Arthur  then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you If you insist on abandoning me I shall not hold you   With that he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room 
 Stunned Allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken making his way past his hosts doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathans residence several miles away 
 
 Nathan read the package of words in silence his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period At long last Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them Allan leaned forward unconsciously 
  Its the best story youve ever written  
 Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts  So   he asked  you don’t think its a waste of ink and paper a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery  
  Heavens no   said Nathan aghast  This is one of the strongest works i’ve read in ages It speaks to the deepest storytellers instinct within us all yet is entirely original My dear friend you have done it Oh they may rail against you at first they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage but while those in power say such things others will read your tales and see their true worth Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now  
 Allan though dubious as to that possibility felt some temptation from the compliment mainly it granted him the encouragement he still needed Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right although the man was somewhat peculiar he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight Certainly it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them His minds strangest fruit had ripened at last and he found the taste less bitter than expected These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home 
 It was evening and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last Passionate fiery colors filled the western sky before him though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead As Allan drew closer he distinguished a new cloud a pillar rising directly ahead a road of smoke ascended in the west its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door 
 Allans thoughts fled as one scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume He ran the last distance crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below walking to the carriage parked before Allans house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicles roof Arthur paused in the door looking up at Allan for a moment then he turned and shut the door behind him The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on As they trotted forth Allans eyes remained trapped by the carriage following it up the hillock and past himself The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows He watched as the carriage drew still more distant the horses hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway 
 When they had gone he remained stunned until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done 
 Rounding the corner he saw a great bonfire A mass of flaming wood stood before him heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house It was a moment before he realized what else had changed near the wall beneath his window was a stump with black and ancient bark 
 In a thoughtless panic Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre His thoughts were not of the acts futility nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing instead all that filled his mind was the trees constant presence in his life growing with him and beside him its persistent reminders that he had higher truer things to write the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn burning logs but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers 
 But he did not weep Instead he bethought himself of the loss of the tree considered also Arthurs motivation and whether some good might not come of this after all Leaving the circle of ashes he stood and turned towards the woods in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood He stepped slowly beneath the branches a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great swirling eddy a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willows last breath 
 Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate He considered Arthurs intervention considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested to write stories that others would read for after all what purpose writing if not to be read  And without that torturous willow he might be free to write whatever he saw fit Indeed if he still could not he could at any time follow Arthurs advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind He found himself along the bank of a low wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current As it turned to the deeper woods elder giants rose above him a beech smooth bark a gray green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark cracked trunks of the nearer trees great pines a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three stroke symbol of the British King a towering black birch leaves impossibly high above him As the stream wound its way through the largest pines grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings Allan continued slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass 
 Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped Before him roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream grew a stand of black willows Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers sprang up where branches reached the ground Though the elders trunks fell and died their children first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead continued unabated a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors 
 Allan stumbled forward jaw slightly slack until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted three trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself Collapsing at its base Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream flowing through the ground beneath them 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 WARTIME
 After the attacks had occurred while crisis managers were still sorting out a number
 of unnerving false alarms Air Force One flew to Barksdale Air Force Base in
 Louisiana One of these alarms was of a reported threat against Air Force One
 itself a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic
 White House Situation Room that morning 
 
 While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington by the time
 Air Force One was airborne at A M the Secret Service the Presidents
 advisers and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising against it President
 Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and at about Air Force One changed
 course and began heading due west The immediate objective was to find a safe
 location not too far away where the President could land and speak to the American
 people The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring
 down the size of the traveling party The Presidents military aide an Air Force
 officer quickly researched the options and sometime around identified
 Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination 
 
 When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about personnel from the local
 Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield The motorcade consisted
 of a military police lead vehicle and a van the proposed briefing theater had no
 phones or electrical outlets Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the
 Presidents remarks while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security
 situation with superiors in Washington The President completed his statement which
 for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live and the traveling party
 returned to Air Force One The next destination was discussed once again the Secret
 Service recommended against returning to Washington and the Vice President agreed 
 Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and
 control facilities and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for 
 persons The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several
 days if necessary 
 
 Air Force One arrived at Offutt at P M At about President Bush met with
 his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference 
 
 Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words  Were at war   and that Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said
 the agency was still assessing who was responsible but the early signs all pointed
 to al Qaeda That evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending
 presidential directive they had labored over during the summer 
 
 The secretary of defense directed the nations armed forces to Defense Condition 
 an increased state of military readiness 
 
 For the first time in history all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United
 States were grounded stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country 
 Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had
 been implemented The Pentagon had been struck the White House or the Capitol had
 narrowly escaped direct attack Extraordinary security precautions were put in place
 at the nations borders and ports 
 In the late afternoon the President overruled his aides continuing reluctance to
 have him return to Washington and ordered Air Force One back to Andrews Air Force
 Base He was flown by helicopter back to the White House passing over the
 still smoldering Pentagon At that evening President Bush addressed the nation
 from the White House After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the
 injured and protect against any further attacks he said  We will make no
 distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor
 them   He quoted Psalm   though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
   No American he said  will ever forget this day  
 
 Following his speech President Bush met again with his National Security Council
 NSC expanded to include Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and Joseph
 Allbaugh the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Secretary of
 State Colin Powell who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks joined
 the discussion They reviewed the days events 
 
 IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME
 As the urgent domestic issues accumulated White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua
 Bolten chaired a temporary  domestic consequences  group 
 
 The agenda in those first days is worth noting partly as a checklist for future
 crisis planners It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the
 flowing losses to the American economy such as
 
 Organizing federal emergency assistance One question was what kind of public
 health advice to give about the air quality in Lower Manhattan in the vicinity
 of the fallen buildings 
 
 Compensating victims They evaluated legislative options eventually setting
 up a federal compensation fund and defining the powers of a special master to
 run it 
 Determining federal assistance On September President Bush promised to
 provide billion for New York City in addition to the billion his budget
 director had already guessed might be needed for the country as a whole 
 
 Restoring civil aviation On the morning of September the national
 airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly improvised security
 standards 
 Reopening the financial markets After extraordinary emergency efforts
 involving the White House the Treasury Department and the Securities and
 Exchange Commission aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually
 competitive firms of the financial industry the markets reopened on Monday 
 September 
 
 Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal
 operations 
 Evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry and cap its
 liability 
 
 The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective
 government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems
 of protection and preparedness Though a number of agencies had some part of the
 task none had security as its primary mission By September Vice President
 Cheney had decided to recommend at least as a first step a new White House entity
 to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of
 combining them in a new department This new White House entity would be a homeland
 security adviser and Homeland Security Council paralleling the National Security
 Council system Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush and
 other advisers President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant 
 Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge in his address to a joint session of Congress on
 September 
 
 Beginning on September Immigration and Naturalization Service agents working in
 cooperation with the FBI began arresting individuals for immigration violations whom
 they encountered while following up leads in the FBIs investigation of the   
 attacks Eventually aliens were arrested as  special interest  detainees Some
 such as Zacarias Moussaoui were actually in INS custody before   most were
 arrested after Attorney General John Ashcroft told us that he saw his job in
 directing this effort as  risk minimization   both to find out who had committed the
 attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack Ashcroft ordered all special interest
 immigration hearings closed to the public family members and press directed
 government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were  cleared 
 of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies and ordered the identity of
 the detainees kept secret INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration
 violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist
 connections in the chaos after the attacks it was very difficult to reach law
 enforcement officials who were following up on other leads The clearance process
 approved by the Justice Department was time consuming lasting an average of about
 days 
 
 We have assessed this effort to detain aliens of  special interest   The detainees
 were lawfully held on immigration charges Records indicate that were deported 
 were released on bond received some kind of immigration benefits had
 their proceedings terminated and  one of whom was Moussaoui were remanded to the
 custody of the U S Marshals Service The inspector general of the Justice
 Department found significant problems in the way the   detainees were
 treated 
 
 In response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits of the   detainee
 program the Justice Department cited six individuals on the special interest
 detainee list noting that two including Moussaoui were linked directly to a
 terrorist organization and that it had obtained new leads helpful to the
 investigation of the   terrorist attacks 
 
 A senior al Qaeda detainee has stated that U S government efforts after the   
 attacks to monitor the American homeland including review of Muslims immigration
 files and deportation of nonpermanent residents forced al Qaeda to operate less
 freely in the United States 
 
 The governments ability to collect intelligence inside the United States and the
 sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement
 communities was not a priority before   Guidelines on this subject issued in
 August by Deputy Attorney General LarryThompson essentially recapitulated prior
 guidance However the attacks of   changed everything Less than one week after
 September an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act officially 
 the USA PATRIOT Act began to take shape 
 
 A central provision of the proposal was the removal of  the wall  on information
 sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities discussed in
 chapter Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action 
 within the limits of the Constitution to identify potential terrorists and deter
 additional attacks 
 
 The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of
 Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 
 
 Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States
 Three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the
 United States in the immediate aftermath of   Did any flights of Saudi
 nationals take place before national airspace reopened on September   
 Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals 
 Did the FBI screen Saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure 
 First we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals domestic or
 international took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning
 of September To the contrary every flight we have identified occurred
 after national airspace reopened 
 
 Second we found no evidence of political intervention We found no evidence that
 anyone at the White House above the level of Richard Clarke participated in a
 decision on the departure of Saudi nationals The issue came up in one of the many
 video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired and Clarke said he
 approved of how the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency
 discussion at his level Clarke told us  I asked the FBI Dale Watson to
 handle that to check to see if that was all right with them to see if they wanted
 access to any of these people and to get back to me And if they had no objections 
 it would be fine with me   Clarke added  I have no recollection of clearing it with
 anybody at the White House  
 
 Although White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card remembered someone telling him about
 the Saudi request shortly after   he said he had not talked to the Saudis and
 did not ask anyone to do anything about it The President and Vice President told us
 they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media 
 None of the officials we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this
 matter from any political appointee 
 
 Third we believe that the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals
 who left the United States on charter flights 
 
 The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBIs requirements that
 passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights
 departed The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI
 operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals
 and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart 
 
 The FBI interviewed all persons of interest on these flights prior to their
 departures They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the   
 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion Our own
 independent review of the Saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known
 links to terrorism departed on these flights 
 
 PLANNING FOR WAR
 By late in the evening of September the President had addressed the nation on the
 terrible events of the day Vice President Cheney described the Presidents mood as
 somber The long day was not yet over When the larger meeting that included his
 domestic department heads broke up President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top
 advisers a group he would later call his  war council   This group usually
 included Vice President Cheney Secretary of State Powell Secretary of Defense
 Donald Rumsfeld General Hugh Shelton Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs later to
 become chairman General Myers DCI Tenet Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI
 Director Robert Mueller From the White House staff National Security Advisor
 Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group often joined
 by their deputies Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten 
 In this restricted National Security Council meeting the President said it was a
 time for self defense The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of
 the attacks but also those who harbored them Secretary Powell said the United
 States had to make it clear to Pakistan Afghanistan and the Arab states that the
 time to act was now He said we would need to build a coalition The President noted
 that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China Secretary
 Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might
 have harbored the attackers including Iraq Afghanistan Libya Sudan and Iran He
 wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with
 these countries pointing out that major strikes could take up to days to
 assemble 
 
 President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September In the first
 meeting he stressed that the United States was at war with a new and different kind
 of enemy The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre    work and
 develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them As
 they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign they
 considered a paper that went beyond al Qaeda to propose the  elimination of
 terrorism as a threat to our way of life   an aim that would include pursuing other
 international terrorist organizations in the Middle East 
 
 Rice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September in the Situation Room to
 refine how the fight against al Qaeda would be conducted The principals agreed that
 the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm The
 United States would need to integrate diplomacy financial measures intelligence 
 and military actions into an overarching strategy The principals also focused on
 Pakistan and what it could do to turn the Taliban against al Qaeda They concluded
 that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States it too would be at
 risk 
 
 The same day Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage met with the Pakistani
 ambassador to the United States Maleeha Lodhi and the visiting head of Pakistans
 military intelligence service Mahmud Ahmed Armitage said that the United States
 wanted Pakistan to take seven steps 
 
 to stop al Qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical support for
 Bin Ladin 
 to give the United States blanket overflight and landing rights for all
 necessary military and intelligence operations 
 to provide territorial access to U S and allied military intelligence and
 other personnel to conduct operations against al Qaeda 
 to provide the United States with intelligence information 
 to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts 
 to cut off all shipments of fuel to the Taliban and stop recruits from going
 to Afghanistan and 
 if the evidence implicated bin Ladin and al Qaeda and the Taliban continued to
 harbor them to break relations with the Taliban government 
 
 
 Pakistan made its decision swiftly That afternoon Secretary of State Powell
 announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had
 agreed to every U S request for support in the war on terrorism The next day the
 U S embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders
 had agreed to all seven demands   Pakistan will need full US support as it proceeds
 with us   the embassy noted   Musharraf said the GOP government of Pakistan was
 making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would
 pay a domestic price His standing in Pakistan was certain to suffer To
 counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his
 decisions  
 
 At the September NSC meeting when Secretary Powell described Pakistans reply 
 President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban He also
 ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the Taliban The
 President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban step back wait to see if
 they got the message and hit them hard if they did not He made clear that the
 military should focus on targets that would influence the Talibans behavior 
 
 President Bush also tasked the State Department which on the following day delivered
 to the White House a paper titled  Game Plan for a Political  Military Strategy for
 Pakistan and Afghanistan   The paper took it as a given that Bin Ladin would
 continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control It
 therefore detailed specific U S demands for the Taliban surrender Bin Ladin and
 his chief lieutenants including Ayman al Zawahiri tell the United States what the
 Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations close all terrorist camps free all
 imprisoned foreigners and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions 
 
 The State Department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the Taliban produce Bin
 Ladin and his deputies and shut down al Qaeda camps within to hours or the
 United States will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure 
 The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply Therefore State and
 Defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan Both
 departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence 
 basing and other support from countries according to their capabilities and
 resources Finally the plan detailed a public U S stance America would use all
 its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat punish those responsible for the
   attacks hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to
 terrorists work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks and
 avoid malice toward any people religion or culture 
 
 President Bush recalled that he quickly realized that the administration would have
 to invade Afghanistan with ground troops 
 
 But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options
 were disappointing Tommy Franks the commanding general of Central Command
 CENTCOM told us that the President was dissatisfied The U S military Franks
 said did not have an off the shelf plan to eliminate the al Qaeda threat in
 Afghanistan The existing Infinite Resolve options did not in his view amount to
 such a plan 
 
 All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September
   as President Bush convened his war council at Camp David 
 
 Present were Vice President Cheney Rice Hadley Powell Armitage Rumsfeld 
 Ashcroft Mueller Tenet Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Cofer
 Black chief of the DCIs Counterterrorist Center 
 Tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations He
 proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would
 join the fight against al Qaeda These CIA teams would act jointly with the
 militarys Special Operations units President Bush later praised this proposal 
 saying it had been a turning point in his thinking 
 
 General Shelton briefed the principals on the preliminary plan for Afghanistan that
 the military had put together It drew on the Infinite Resolve  phased campaign 
 plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November as an addition to the strike
 options it had been refining since But Shelton added a new element the
 possible significant use of ground forces  and that is where President Bush
 reportedly focused his attention 
 
 After hearing from his senior advisers President Bush discussed with Rice the
 contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion Rice
 prepared a paper that President Bush then considered with principals on Monday
 morning September  The purpose of this meeting   he recalled saying  is to
 assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism It starts today  
 
 In a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting 
 President Bush charged Ashcroft Mueller and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland
 defense President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to deliver an ultimatum
 to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed The
 State Department was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize Pakistan and to be
 prepared to notify Russia and countries near Afghanistan when hostilities were
 imminent 
 
 In addition Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action
 in Afghanistan including the administrations first Memorandum of Notification on
 Bin Ladin Shortly thereafter President Bush authorized broad new authorities for
 the CIA 
 
 President Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David
 military plan to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the
 ultimatum The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to
 protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented
 worldwide Finally he directed Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill to craft a plan to
 target al Qaedas funding and seize its assets 
 
 NSC staff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fund raising by September
 
 
 Also by September Powell had contacted of his foreign counterparts and
 received offers of general aid search and rescue equipment and personnel and
 medical assistance teams 
 
 On the same day Deputy Secretary of State Armitage was called by Mahmud Ahmed
 regarding a two day visit to Afghanistan during which the Pakistani intelligence
 chief had met with Mullah Omar and conveyed the U S demands Omars response was
  not negative on all these points   But the
 administration knew that theTaliban was unlikely to turn over Bin Ladin 
 
 The pre    draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive 
 National Security Presidential Directive now titled  Defeating the Terrorist
 Threat to the United States   The directive would now extend to a global war on
 terrorism not just on al Qaeda It also incorporated the Presidents determination
 not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them It included a
 determination to use military force if necessary to end al Qaedas sanctuary in
 Afghanistan The new directive formally signed on October after the fighting in
 Afghanistan had already begun included new material followed by annexes discussing
 each targeted terrorist group The old draft directive on al Qaeda became in
 effect the first annex 
 
 The United States would strive to eliminate all terrorist networks dry up their
 financial support and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction The
 goal was the  elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life  
 
  PHASE TWO  AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ
 President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Husseins
 regime might have had a hand in it Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for
 years and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in
 ongoing combat operations As a former pilot the President was struck by the
 apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting especially
 Hanjours high speed dive into the Pentagon He told us he recalled Iraqi support
 for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well Speculating about other possible states
 that could be involved the President told us he also thought about Iran 
 
 Clarke has written that on the evening of September President Bush told him and
 some of his staff to explore possible Iraqi links to    See if Saddam did this  
 Clarke recalls the President telling them   See if he’s linked in any way   While he believed the details of Clarkes account to be
 incorrect President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at
 some point asking him about Iraq 
 
 Responding to a presidential tasking Clarkes office sent a memo to Rice on
 September titled  Survey of Intelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in
 the September Attacks   Rices chief staffer on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad 
 concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al
 Qaeda The memo found no  compelling case  that Iraq had either planned or
 perpetrated the attacks It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports 
 including the Czech report alleging an April Prague meeting between Atta and an
 Iraqi intelligence officer discussed in chapter and a Polish report that
 personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad were told before
 September to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event 
 Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak the memo pointed
 out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Husseins regime Finally the
 memo said there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on
 unconventional weapons 
 
 On the afternoon of   according to contemporaneous notes Secretary Rumsfeld
 instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible The
 notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking
 empty training sites He thought the U S response should consider a wide range of
 options and possibilities The secretary said his instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein
 at the same time not only Bin Ladin Secretary Rumsfeld later explained that at the
 time he had been considering either one of them or perhaps someone else as the
 responsible party 
 
 According to Rice the issue of what if anything to do about Iraq was really
 engaged at Camp David Briefing papers on Iraq along with many others were in
 briefing materials for the participants Rice told us the administration was
 concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the   attacks She recalled that in
 the first Camp David session chaired by the President Rumsfeld asked what the
 administration should do about Iraq Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for
 striking Iraq during  this round  of the war on terrorism 
 
 A Defense Department paper for the Camp David briefing book on the strategic concept
 for the war on terrorism specified three priority targets for initial action al
 Qaeda theTaliban and Iraq It argued that of the three al Qaeda and Iraq posed a
 strategic threat to the United States Iraqs long standing involvement in terrorism
 was cited along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction 
 
 Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz not Rumsfeld argued that Iraq was ultimately
 the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked 
 
 Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq was behind
    Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt
 with   Powell told us   And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to
 deal with the Iraq problem   Powell said that President Bush did not give
 Wolfowitzs argument  much weight   Though continuing to
 worry about Iraq in the following week Powell said President Bush saw Afghanistan
 as the priority 
 
 President Bush told Bob Woodward that the decision not to invade Iraq was made at the
 morning session on September Iraq was not even on the table during the September
 afternoon session which dealt solely with Afghanistan 
 
 Rice said that when President Bush called her on Sunday September he said the
 focus would be on Afghanistan although he still wanted plans for Iraq should the
 country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been
 involved in the   attacks 
 
 At the September NSC meeting there was some further discussion of  phase two  of
 the war on terrorism 
 
 President Bush ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if
 Baghdad acted against U S interests with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi
 oil fields 
 
 Within the Pentagon Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for
 dealing with Iraq Writing to Rumsfeld on September in a memo headlined
  Preventing More Events  he argued that if there was even a percent chance that
 Saddam Hussein was behind the   attack maximum priority should be placed on
 eliminating that threat Wolfowitz contended that the odds were  far more  than in
 citing Saddams praise for the attack his long record of involvement in
 terrorism and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the
 attack on the World Trade Center The next day Wolfowitz renewed the
 argument writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef s co conspirator in the
 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives laden plane into CIA headquarters 
 and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis involvement in the
 attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight Given this background he wondered why so
 little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots seeing a  failure
 of imagination  and a mind set that dismissed possibilities 
 
 On September Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked
 on their contingency plans Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the
 conflict the references to specific enemies or regions named only the Taliban al
 Qaeda and Afghanistan 
 
 Shelton told us the administration reviewed all the Pentagons war plans and
 challenged certain assumptions underlying them as any prudent organization or
 leader should do 
 
 General Tommy Franks the commanding general of Central Command recalled receiving
 Rumsfelds guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans
 meant for his area of responsibility He knew he would soon be striking the Taliban
 and al Qaeda in Afghanistan But he told us he now wondered how that action was
 connected to what might need to be done in Somalia Yemen or Iraq 
 
 On September President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the
 two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead When Blair asked about Iraq the
 President replied that Iraq was not the immediate problem Some members of his
 administration he commented had expressed a different view but he was the one
 responsible for making the decisions 
 
 Franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on
 military responses in Iraq during the summer before    a request President Bush
 denied arguing that the time was not right CENTCOM also began dusting off plans
 for a full invasion of Iraq during this period Franks said The CENTCOM commander
 told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi
 moves shortly after   both because he personally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda
 might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that Saddam might
 take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern
 or southern parts of Iraq where the United States was flying regular missions to
 enforce Iraqi no fly zones Franks said that President Bush again turned down the
 request 
 
 Having issued directives to guide his administrations preparations for war on
 Thursday September President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session
 of Congress   Tonight   he said  we are a country awakened to danger   The President blamed al Qaeda for   and the 
 embassy bombings and for the first time declared that al Qaeda was  responsible
 for bombing the USS Cole   He reiterated the ultimatum
 that had already been conveyed privately   The Taliban must act and act
 immediately   he said   They will hand over the terrorists or they will share in
 their fate   The President added that Americas quarrel
 was not with Islam  The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends it is not
 our many Arab friends Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every
 government that supports them   Other regimes faced hard choices he pointed out 
  Every nation in every region now has a decision to make Either you are with us 
 or you are with the terrorists  
 
 President Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin   Our war on terror
 begins with al Qaeda but it does not end there   he said   It will not end until
 every terrorist group of global reach has been found stopped and defeated   The
 President had a message for the Pentagon  The hour is coming when America will act 
 and you will make us proud   He also had a message for those outside the United
 States   This is civilizations fight   he said  We ask every nation to join
 us  
 
 President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central
 Commands General Franks and other advisers on September and October 
 Originally titled  Infinite Justice   the operations code word was changed to avoid
 the sensibilities of Muslims who associate the power of infinite justice with God
 alone to the operational name still used for operations in Afghanistan  Enduring
 Freedom  
 
 The plan had four phases 
 
 In Phase One the United States and its allies would move forces into the
 region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as
 Uzbekistan and Pakistan This occurred in the weeks following   aided by
 overwhelming international sympathy for the United States 
 In Phase Two air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al
 Qaeda and Taliban targets In an innovative joint effort CIA and Special
 Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan
 faction opposed to the Taliban The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October
 The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially
 secured after arduous effort by the end of that month 
 In Phase Three the United States would carry out  decisive operations  using
 all elements of national power including ground troops to topple the Taliban
 regime and eliminate al Qaedas sanctuary in Afghanistan Mazar e Sharif in
 northern Afghanistan fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U S forces on
 November Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul By early December 
 all major cities had fallen to the coalition On December Hamid Karzai a
 Pashtun leader from Kandahar was installed as the chairman of Afghanistans
 interim administration Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the
 Taliban 
 
 In December Afghan forces with limited U S support engaged al Qaeda elements
 in a cave complex called Tora Bora In March the largest engagement of the war
 was fought in the mountainous Shah i Kot area south of Gardez against a large
 force of al Qaeda jihadists The three week battle was substantially successful and
 almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistans equally mountainous
 and lightly governed frontier provinces As of July Bin Ladin and Zawahiri are
 still believed to be at large 
 
 In Phase Four civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task
 of what the armed forces call  security and stability operations  
 
 Within about two months of the start of combat operations several hundred CIA
 operatives and Special Forces soldiers backed by the striking power of U S 
 aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts had
 combined with Afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to
 destroy theTaliban regime and disrupt al Qaeda They had killed or captured about a
 quarter of the enemys known leaders Mohammed Atef al Qaedas military commander
 and a principal figure in the   plot had been killed by a U S air strike 
 According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy the CIA
 provided intelligence experience cash covert action capabilities and entrée to
 tribal allies In turn the U S military offered combat expertise firepower 
 logistics and communications 
 
 With these initial victories won by the middle of the global conflict against
 Islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle 
 
 





Introduction 

As recognized by the Presidents National Energy Plan NEP one
of the principal energy challenges facing us is increasing our
energy supplies in ways that protect and improve the environment 
Thus the President directed EPA to propose legislation that would
significantly reduce SO NOx and mercury emissions from power
generation through a cap and trade program Such a program coupled
with appropriate measures to address local concerns would provide
significant health benefits even as we increase energy supplies and
maintain reasonable electricity rates 
Our work on this issue has given us insight that I believe will
be helpful to you The more I learn about the cost and
inefficiencies of the current and future regulatory regime to which
power generators will be subjected if we do not have new
legislation the more I am convinced that we can   and must   
develop a smarter approach that protects the environment and public
health while reducing the cost to consumers and industry and
optimizing the size of both the state and federal government
machinery necessary to achieve that protection It is possible to
achieve better results at lower costs 
but not if we simply add yet another program on top of all of
the existing regulations 
The current Clean Air Act has been enormously successful but we
can do better Significant cost savings can be achieved for power
generators and consumers through a comprehensive legislative
package I look forward to working with you to develop such an
approach to reduce emissions from power generation We applaud
Senator Jeffords for tackling this important issue and for
recognizing that a cap and trade program is the best way to achieve
these reductions However we have significant concerns with S 
as drafted Our analysis to date suggests that it could increase
consumers electricity rates by as much as which we believe is
unacceptable In addition the combination of emission reductions
and timing is not feasible and could threaten the reliability of
electricity supply We are concerned that S s short timeframes
for installation of controls could lead power plants to be taken
off line at important times which could lead to electricity
shortages 
In addition there are a number of issues that Congress should
consider that S does not address As drafted S would
make some existing requirements unnecessary but would not
eliminate them Rather than add yet another layer of environmental
regulations on top of the existing ones we believe that S 
should eliminate those unnecessary existing requirements S 
also does not have an allocation scheme One lesson we should learn
from the success of the Acid Rain cap and trade program is that
when certain key issues can be resolved through clear legislation 
we can avoid years of litigation business uncertainty and costs 
and delayed environmental protection 
Finally and most importantly the Administration strongly
opposes including CO reductions in any multi pollutant bill The
CO provisions in S will cost consumers too much and endanger
our energy security by causing too much electricity generation to
switch from coal to natural gas Greenhouse gas emissions should be
addressed in the context of climate change which is being
undertaken by the Presidents Cabinet level working group For all
of these reasons the Administration must oppose S In my
testimony today I will elaborate further on these key points 


Background 

Over the last years we have made substantial progress
towards improved environmental quality under the Clean Air Act 
During this time gross domestic product has increased almost 
At the same time we have reduced emissions of six key air
pollutants by while coal consumption has increased and
energy consumption has increased Eleven years ago President
George H W Bush signed into law the most far reaching amendments
to the Clean Air Act since its enactment in Included in those
amendments was the Acid Rain cap and trade program the first
program tailored specifically to the utility sector which is
achieving significant environmental and public health benefits at a
fraction of the initial cost estimates and with relatively little
government bureaucracy It is time to revisit and update the Clean
Air Act once again in order to achieve the additional reductions
needed to address public health and environmental problems in the
most cost effective manner 
The Acid Rain Program is achieving its emission reduction goal
at a fraction of the estimated costs because it allows and
encourages innovative thinking and long range planning The
existing program establishes a cap on SO emissions to ensure that
the environmental goal is met and employs an innovative
market based allowance trading program to achieve the goal at
lowest cost Allowances are the currency with which compliance with
the SO emissions requirements is achieved Sources rather than
government decide the most cost effective way to use available
resources to comply Units that reduce their emissions below the
number of allowances they hold may trade allowances with other
units in the system sell them to other sources or save them for
future use There are neither restrictions on trading nor
government second guessing 
Allowance trading provides incentives for energy conservation
and technology innovation that can both lower the cost of
compliance and yield pollution prevention benefits Simply the
allowance market puts a price or value on each ton of SO not 
emitted The association of a monetary value
with reduced emissions encourages innovation in the s 
scrubber costs decreased by approximately and scrubber sulfur
removal efficiencies improved from to and experimentation
led to the blending of fuels to lower emissions To ensure that the
cap is met and to provide credibility sources also are required to
install systems that continuously monitor and report emissions 
The Acid Rain Program has proven to be an excellent model for
cap and trade programs Compliance with the program has been nearly
 percent and annual emissions of SO from power plants have
already been reduced over million tons about percent from
 levels Greater reductions earlier than expected have lowered
risks to human health and provided benefits to the environment
sooner Acid rain levels were dramatically reduced over large areas
of the U S and trading did not result in geographic shifting of
emissions or  hot spots  as some feared 
Despite the significant progress we have made under the Clean
Air Act air emissions from power generators are still contributing
to serious public health and environmental problems Administrator
Whitman addressed these concerns extensively in her testimony
before you on July Rather than reiterate her testimony I
will emphasize just a few of her key points Problems associated
with sulfur dioxide SO nitrogen oxides NOx and mercury
emissions are of national and international significance and the
interstate and long range transport of emissions continue to play
significant roles in the nature and magnitude of the problems 
Emission and deposition of SO NOx and mercury and their
transformation byproducts are known to have a wide range of adverse
effects on human health and the environment including 
  SO and NOx emissions contribute to fine particles which are
associated with premature mortality aggravated chronic bronchitis 
hospitalizations due to cardio respiratory symptoms emergency room
visits due to aggravated asthma symptoms and acute respiratory
symptoms 
 Governor Whitmans July testimony before this
Committee contains a detailed discussion of the success of the Acid
Rain cap and trade program 
Fine particles formed from power plant emissions as well as
mobile source emissions are of
concern   NOx emissions contribute to ground level ozone 
which aggravates respiratory illnesses and causes lung
inflammation particularly for at risk populations such as
children the elderly and those afflicted with asthma emphysema 
and other respiratory ailments 
  Mercury emissions contribute to mercury deposition in water 
Children born to women who consume large amounts of
mercury contaminated fish while pregnant may be at risk for
neurodevelopmental defects 
  SO and NOx emissions contribute to atmospheric sulfate and
nitrate concentrations that cause visibility impairment including
impairment in many national parks and wilderness areas 
  SO and NOx contribute to acid deposition which damages
lakes and streams adversely affecting the fish and other species
that live in them and leaches nutrients from the soil 
  NOx emissions contribute to nitrogen deposition that may lead
to eutrophication of estuaries and near coastal waters and can
damage forested watersheds 
EPA states and industry working together have made important
strides in addressing the adverse impacts of fossil fuel combustion
by the electric power industry since the passage of the Clean Air
Act in Despite significant improvements in air quality
throughout the country however emissions from power generation
continue to result in serious health environmental and economic
impacts In the electric power industry was responsible for
 of sulfur dioxide emissions of nitrogen oxide emissions 
and of mercury emissions in the United States 


Business as Usual 

The Presidents flexible market based approach to reducing
emissions from power generators stands in sharp contrast to the
complex web of existing regulations which currently confront the
industry Over the years Congress EPA and the States have
responded to specific environmental and public health problems by
developing separate regulatory programs to address the specific
problems Each individual program uses its own approach on its own
timeline to serve its own purpose Absent changes to the Act EPA
and states will be forced to follow the same approach in future
regulations It is time to consolidate and simplify to achieve our
clean air goals A comprehensive legislative approach with
mandatory caps could replace a good portion of the current
regulatory requirements with a system that will reduce the
administrative burden on industry and governments use market based
approaches to lower compliance costs reduce consumers costs and
increase national energy security by providing the industry with
more certainty about its future regulatory obligations By enacting
such an approach we can achieve environmental and public health
protection more effectively and at less cost If we do it the
Presidents way it will be a win win 
There are many regulations in place that will reduce air
emissions from electric power generation These regulations include
both federal and State requirements that address a variety of
emissions including SO NOx CO PM and a number of hazardous
air pollutants These programs
include the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for SO 
particulate matter and ozone the section and the NOx SIP Call
rules the Acid Rain Program new source review new source
performance standards and the regional haze rule 
But the regulation of power generators does not end with
existing regulations EPA is obligated by a settlement agreement to
issue by the end of a Maximum Achievable Control Technology
 MACT standard to require source specific controls of mercury and
other hazardous air pollutants from electric utilities Emissions
reductions are required by the end of States will also be
requiring utilities to comply with Best Available Retrofit
Technology BART programs either source specific standards or a
trading program to meet requirements to reduce regional haze 
It is expected that the existing fine particle and ozone
standards now in place will also result in further regulation of
power generators Modeling shows that when full implementation of
existing regulations such as the acid rain program the NOx SIP
Call the Tier II standards for cars and trucks the heavy duty
diesel engine standards and the low sulfur gasoline and diesel
fuel rules are taken into account additional reductions will be
needed to bring areas into attainment States will be required to
develop plans for these areas In addition NOx and SO reductions
are also needed to reduce continuing damage from acid rain and
nitrogen deposition 
Because states and EPA will have to find some way to
significantly reduce NOx and SO emissions it is probable that
power generators will be required to reduce their emissions
significantly Power generation accounts for a significant
percentage of these emissions and our analysis shows that there
are significant reductions available at lower cost than from other
sources Additionally states know that if they do not get the
reductions from power generators they will have to impose
significant reduction requirements on other local industrial and
commercial sources or impose local transportation control
measures 
Under current law the necessary reductions would be achieved
through the development of individual state plans States will not
just control their own sources however They will be reaching out
to control power generators and large industrial facilities in
other states because transport from other states contributes to
both ozone and fine particle pollution in many areas This is what
has happened in the eastern part of the country when states
realized that emissions from sources in other states were
significantly contributing to their  hour ozone non attainment
problems Under section of the Clean Air Act a state can
petition EPA and request that EPA require reductions from sources
outside the petitioning states borders The petitioning state is
entitled to relief if EPA finds that the sources are significantly
contributing to the petitioning states nonattainment problem 
EPAs requirement adopted in response to section petitions 
that sources in a number of eastern states reduce NOx emissions was
recently upheld by the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit Since states now know that EPA has authority to
address transport pollution through responses to petitions or
by issuing a rule like the NOx SIP Call we anticipate that states
will be turning to these types of control approaches early in the
SIP process Although those of us who are
traveling that path with the current petitions and NOx SIP
Call believe it will eventually take us to our environmental goal 
it has been    and still is    a very rocky road for industry 
environmentalists the states EPA and other stakeholders 
This one at a time uncoordinated series of regulatory
requirements for the power industry is not the optimal approach for
the environment the power generation sector or American
consumers With most plants needing to install control equipment to
meet these requirements it is likely that this approach would lead
to installation of controls that become obsolete and stranded
capital investments as additional requirements are promulgated 
Further the attainment efforts of individual States and localities
not only impose costs on these entities but also can increase
complexity for companies which face differing requirements when
operations cross state lines These factors are exacerbated by
limited timeframes that may constrain available compliance options
and thwart long range planning These and other inefficiencies
point to the need for a nationally coordinated approach that could
reduce cost while improving environmental progress and
accountability 


Changing the Way We Do Business Certainty Flexibility 
Accountability and Innovation 

We believe there is a better way one that could cost American
consumers and industry far less than under current law and ensure
protection of the air we breathe in a far more certain 
straightforward manner I know that many members of this Committee
share that belief and are also working to develop such an approach 
It would provide power generators with more certainty about their
regulatory future and thus allow them to make wiser decisions about
investments in new technology which would improve energy security 
This Administration is developing such a proposal It will build on
the successes of the Acid Rain cap and trade program It would
establish national cap and trade programs for NOx SO and mercury
emissions from power generators with appropriate measures to
address local concerns Such an approach will benefit the power
generation industry the economy and the states while improving
public health and the environment 
Up front knowledge of future requirements for multiple
pollutants would lead firms to follow significantly different and
less expensive compliance strategies at individual plants compared
with compliance choices which must be made as requirements are
addressed in a sequential manner under the current law The savings
come from the opportunity to make cost effective plant investment
and retirement decisions with full knowledge of upcoming SO NOx
and mercury requirements rather than investing in  add on  control
equipment to meet the requirements of each regulation Integration 
advance knowledge and certainty regarding environmental
requirements will have even greater value over the coming decade as
the electric power industry undergoes further structural changes 
An integrated package of measures that addresses both the existing
regulatory requirements as well as many future environmental needs
would provide the greatest degree of certainty and flexibility for
the industry while achieving the necessary emission reductions at
lower cost than under current law 
In exchange for flexibility in methods to control emissions a
full accounting of emissions through
continuous monitoring and reporting is essential as well as
significant consequences for failing to comply Such provisions
have been critical to the success of the Acid Rain Program 
encouraging individual sources to find the most cost effective
means of compliance with the collective emission reduction
goal 
Flexibility stimulates technological innovation fuels economic
activity and reduces cost to industry and consumers Strategies and
technologies for the control of SO NOx and mercury emissions
exist now and improved methods are expected to become available
over the next several years The air pollution control and
monitoring technology industry is expected to continue to respond
with cost effective compliance solutions just as they have done for
the past years A predictable demand for such jobs over the next
 years is preferable to the boom and bust cycle created by the
current regulatory approach 
This approach also would reduce states administrative burdens
and obligations A national cap and trade program with appropriate
caps for NOx and SO could provide the emission reductions
necessary to bring a significant number of areas into attainment
with the ozone and fine particle standards Even those areas that
would not be brought into attainment by these caps would need
significantly fewer emission reductions to come into attainment 
Our approach would significantly reduce the state resources needed
to conduct modeling planning and regulatory activities to attain
the standards Additionally the Acid Rain cap and trade program is
administered with a relatively small staff relying on strong 
state of the art data tracking and reporting capabilities Thus 
well designed national cap and trade programs can help use
government resources and taxpayer dollars more efficiently at both
the state and federal level 
Caps ensure that environmental goals are met A cap that
represents significant reductions of emissions protects the
environment by reducing overall loadings Consideration of local
concerns is important in conjunction with trading provisions 
Therefore the National Energy Plan recommended that the
Administrations approach include appropriate measures to address
local concerns such as the unlikely occurrence of an SO  hot
spot  or area of concentrated emissions Significant reductions
will go a long way towards addressing local concerns In addition 
EPA will be conducting modeling that will predict where emissions
reductions will occur Under the Acid Rain cap and trade program 
we have not seen local hot spots because the highest emitters are
often the most cost effective to control and therefore the most
likely to control 
As I mentioned EPA and the Administration are still in the
process of developing our proposal Several guidelines are shaping
our efforts These guidelines may provide a valuable basis as you
weigh the proposals before you They will also guide our assessment
of other proposals including S These principles are
structured to ensure consistency with the NEP objectives The NEP
goals of increasing energy supplies accelerating the protection
and improvement of the environment and increasing our nations
energy supply must be advanced Towards that end energy diversity 
the preservation of electricity generation and transmission
reliability and improvement of energy
 efficiency energy intensity of the electric power industry
should be a key consideration In particular to prevent the
reoccurrence of energy shortages and price volatility a diverse
mix of fuel sources should be maintained 


Specific Comments on S 

We share the desire expressed in S to significantly reduce
and cap emissions of SO NOx and mercury from power generation We
applaud your acknowledgment of market based incentives 
particularly cap and trade systems as a powerful tool in
environmental protection In this way S builds on successful
elements of the Clean Air Act 
We do however oppose S because of concerns with the bill
   both with some provisions that are in the bill and with some
that are missing We believe the emission reductions and timing in
the bill will be too costly for consumers and will endanger
national energy security We believe the bill is missing some
provisions    it should address the allocation scheme and
integration with existing programs Finally we oppose inclusion of
CO in this bill 
First let me explain some of our specific concerns about the
SO NOx and mercury provisions in the bill We are concerned that
the significant emissions reductions are required too quickly We
do not believe it is reasonable to expect all the control
technology installations to be completed in that time frame without
very high costs and electricity reliability problems To meet these
deadlines facilities may need to be taken off line during critical
periods Reliability problems could arise as large amounts of
capacity are taken out of service for extended periods of time to
install the control equipment necessary to meet the emissions
reduction requirements The abbreviated time frame would force many
generators to make these retrofits simultaneously This would
significantly reduce the amount of generating capacity available to
meet consumer electrical needs 
We have not modeled the specific provisions in S but
useful information is provided by comparing the analyses EPA and
EIA conducted to respond to a request from Senators Smith 
Voinovich and Brownback with the analyses responding to a request
from Senators Jeffords and Lieberman In the
Smith Voinovich Brownback analysis when we analyzed SO and NOx
reduction levels similar to S mercury reduction levels more
modest than S and no CO reductions we did not find
significant impacts on coal production or electricity prices 
However in the analysis responding to the Jeffords Lieberman
request that had NOx SO mercury and CO reduction levels similar
to S we found significant ramifications approximately a
   decline of coal generation and a   increase in
electricity prices compared to the reference case depending on
assumptions of energy technology penetration 
The source specific control for mercury is also problematic 
We have not seen anything that demonstrates that every coal fired
power plant would be able to achieve source specific controls
for mercury by without considerable fuel switching which
would be very disruptive to our economy and undermine energy
security In addition requiring the same level of reduction at
a
plant that emits pounds of mercury and a plant that emits
 pounds of mercury   regardless of cost   is neither efficient
nor necessary 
We are also very concerned about the  outdated power plant 
provision Requiring every plant over years old to meet New
Source Performance Standards and New Source Review modification
requirements seems unnecessary and could undermine the benefits of
the cap and trade approach Allowing sources to make reductions
where it is most economical to do so is one of the reasons cap and
trade programs should be less costly than command and control
programs that achieve the same or even fewer reductions When you
have a hard cap as you would under S requiring emission
reductions at a specific source does not reduce the overall level
of pollution it just limits industrys flexibility about where to
make the reductions Layering additional requirements such as the
 outdated power plants  provision on top of a cap and trade
program is very likely to increase costs without providing
significant environmental benefits 
Second we have concerns about what is not in S Comparing
our experience on the Acid Rain Program with the NOx SIP Call and
the Section petitions demonstrates the benefit of having
certain key issues decided by Congress rather than left to Agency
rulemakings Congressional resolution of key issues simplifies
whatever Agency rulemaking is needed and decreases the
opportunities for the program to get tied up in protracted
litigation 
Perhaps the most important program element not addressed in the
bill is integration of this new program with the existing Clean Air
Act provisions An effective market based approach would make some
existing provisions of the Clean Air Act unnecessary For example 
depending on the ultimate cap levels chosen by Congress this type
of legislation would obviate the need for Best Available Retrofit
Technology requirements mercury MACT and new source review
case by case technology requirements for power generators 
Also missing from S is the scheme for allocating
allowances Developing an allocation scheme requires answering
numerous questions Should the allowances be auctioned off or be
handed out for free  If they are not auctioned should they be
allocated based on heat input or electrical and steam output 
Should power generators that do not emit air pollutants e g 
hydropower facilities be given allowances  Should allowance
allocations be updated and if so how frequently  Should
allocations be fuel neutral  Imbedded in these and other questions
are important environmental and energy policy choices with
significant equity consequences It may not be efficient for EPA to
make these choices in rulemaking 
There are other issues as well that this Committee should
consider such as coordination with existing state and regional
programs like the Western Regional Air Partnership and the NOx
reduction programs in the east The Committee may also wish to
consider provisions to track environmental progress to evaluate the
efficacy of the program this bill would establish 
Finally the Administration strongly opposes including
reductions for CO in S or any multi pollutant bill Pursuing
sharp reductions in CO from the electricity generating sector
alone would cause a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas and
thus would run the risk of endangering national energy security 
substantially increasing energy prices and harming consumers 
The Administration will not support any legislation that would
cause a significant decline in our nations ability to use coal as
a major source of current and future electricity At the same time 
the Administration will not support any legislation that does not
enhance the cleanliness of coal fired electricity generation and
promote a future for clean coal technologies In short the
Administration supports a clean coal policy as a critical component
of our nations energy and environmental policies recognizing that
other sources of energy also have a critical role to play 
Additionally as Governor Whitman said when she testified before
you in July including CO in this bill will slow down if not
prevent the consensus necessary for passage of legislation to
control multiple emissions from power plants Governor Whitman and
I both believe consensus on the appropriate levels and timing for
reductions of NOx SO and mercury is achievable relatively soon 
We should not delay the public health and environmental benefits
from reduction of these emissions while we wait for consensus to
develop on CO 
We agree that climate change is a serious issue we need to
address However CO has never been regulated as a pollutant under
the Clean Air Act and does not pose any direct threat to human
health unlike NOx SO and mercury The current body of scientific
knowledge does not provide information regarding atmospheric
concentrations of CO or reduction levels necessary to prevent
dangerous interference with the climate system 
In April the President convened a Cabinet level policy review
of this issue and was provided with initial recommendations that he
accepted and announced on June In that regard the
Administration is implementing two major initiatives on climate
science and advanced energy and sequestration technologies The
United States now spends billion annually on climate science
to reduce uncertainties   a commitment unmatched by any other
nation The  National Climate Change Technology Initiative  will
accelerate priority research and the application of advanced energy
and sequestration technologies recognizing that the real answer to
addressing climate change in the long term lies in the development
and global introduction of such technologies in this century And
the cabinet level policy review is ongoing Finally as greenhouse
gas emissions are projected to grow exponentially in the developing
world in the next two decades we must evaluate the costs of
imposing domestic reductions as a very high cost against
potentially low cost opportunities for mitigating and sequestering
carbon emissions in the developing world 
We appreciate the role of S in generating important
discussions and emphasizing the importance of a new approach to
controlling emissions in the power sector I look forward to the
additional hearings you will need to address these important issues
and to working with the Committee
to develop an approach that the President can support 
The history of Clean Air Act legislation is one of great
accomplishments made possible by bipartisan efforts I thank you
for the opportunity to work with you to continue that great
tradition 




CONCLUSIONS OF THE 
FINANCIAL CRISIS INQUIRY COMMISSION

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission has been called upon to examine the financial 
and economic crisis that has gripped our country and explain its causes to the 
American people We are keenly aware of the significance of our charge given the 
economic damage that America has suffered in the wake of the greatest financial crisis 
since the Great Depression 

Our task was first to determine what happened and how it happened so that we 
could understand why it happened Here we present our conclusions We encourage 
the American people to join us in making their own assessments based on the evidence 
gathered in our inquiry If we do not learn from history we are unlikely to fully 
recover from it Some on Wall Street and in Washington with a stake in the status quo 
may be tempted to wipe from memory the events of this crisis or to suggest that no 
one could have foreseen or prevented them This report endeavors to expose the 
facts identify responsibility unravel myths and help us understand how the crisis 
could have been avoided It is an attempt to record history not to rewrite it nor allow 
it to be rewritten 

To help our fellow citizens better understand this crisis and its causes we also present 
specific conclusions at the end of chapters in Parts III IV and V of this report 

The subject of this report is of no small consequence to this nation The profound 
events of and were neither bumps in the road nor an accentuated dip in 
the financial and business cycles we have come to expect in a free market economic 
system This was a fundamental disruption a financial upheaval if you will that 
wreaked havoc in communities and neighborhoods across this country 

As this report goes to print there are more than million Americans who are 
out of work cannot find full time work or have given up looking for work About 
four million families have lost their homes to foreclosure and another four and a half 
million have slipped into the foreclosure process or are seriously behind on their 
mortgage payments Nearly trillion in household wealth has vanished with retirement 
accounts and life savings swept away Businesses large and small have felt 
the sting of a deep recession There is much anger about what has transpired and justifiably 
so Many people who abided by all the rules now find themselves out of work 
and uncertain about their future prospects The collateral damage of this crisis has 
been real people and real communities The impacts of this crisis are likely to be felt 
for a generation And the nation faces no easy path to renewed economic strength 

Like so many Americans we began our exploration with our own views and some 
preliminary knowledge about how the worlds strongest financial system came to the 
brink of collapse Even at the time of our appointment to this independent panel 
much had already been written and said about the crisis Yet all of us have been 
deeply affected by what we have learned in the course of our inquiry We have been at 
various times fascinated surprised and even shocked by what we saw heard and 
read Ours has been a journey of revelation 

Much attention over the past two years has been focused on the decisions by the 
federal government to provide massive financial assistance to stabilize the financial 
system and rescue large financial institutions that were deemed too systemically important 
to fail Those decisions and the deep emotions surrounding them will be 
debated long into the future But our mission was to ask and answer this central question 
how did it come to pass that in our nation was forced to choose between two 
stark and painful alternatives either risk the total collapse of our financial system 
and economy or inject trillions of taxpayer dollars into the financial system and an 
array of companies as millions of Americans still lost their jobs their savings and 
their homes  

In this report we detail the events of the crisis But a simple summary as we see 
it is useful at the outset While the vulnerabilities that created the potential for crisis 
were years in the making it was the collapse of the housing bubble fueled by 
low interest rates easy and available credit scant regulation and toxic mortgages  
that was the spark that ignited a string of events which led to a full blown crisis in 
the fall of Trillions of dollars in risky mortgages had become embedded 
throughout the financial system as mortgage related securities were packaged 
repackaged and sold to investors around the world When the bubble burst hundreds 
of billions of dollars in losses in mortgages and mortgage related securities 
shook markets as well as financial institutions that had significant exposures to 
those mortgages and had borrowed heavily against them This happened not just in 
the United States but around the world The losses were magnified by derivatives 
such as synthetic securities 

The crisis reached seismic proportions in September with the failure of 
Lehman Brothers and the impending collapse of the insurance giant American International 
Group AIG Panic fanned by a lack of transparency of the balance sheets of major 
financial institutions coupled with a tangle of interconnections among institutions 
perceived to be  too big to fail  caused the credit markets to seize up Trading ground 
to a halt The stock market plummeted The economy plunged into a deep recession 

The financial system we examined bears little resemblance to that of our parents 
generation The changes in the past three decades alone have been remarkable The 
financial markets have become increasingly globalized Technology has transformed 
the efficiency speed and complexity of financial instruments and transactions There 
is broader access to and lower costs of financing than ever before And the financial 
sector itself has become a much more dominant force in our economy 

From to the amount of debt held by the financial sector soared from 
 trillion to trillion more than doubling as a share of gross domestic product 
The very nature of many Wall Street firms changed from relatively staid private 
partnerships to publicly traded corporations taking greater and more diverse kinds of 
risks By the largest U S commercial banks held of the industrys assets 
more than double the level held in On the eve of the crisis in financial 
sector profits constituted of all corporate profits in the United States up from 
 in Understanding this transformation has been critical to the Commissions 
analysis 

Now to our major findings and conclusions which are based on the facts contained 
in this report they are offered with the hope that lessons may be learned to 
help avoid future catastrophe 

We conclude this financial crisis was avoidable The crisis was the result of human 
action and inaction not of Mother Nature or computer models gone haywire The 
captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings 
and failed to question understand and manage evolving risks within a system essential 
to the well being of the American public Theirs was a big miss not a stumble 
While the business cycle cannot be repealed a crisis of this magnitude need not have 
occurred To paraphrase Shakespeare the fault lies not in the stars but in us 
Despite the expressed view of many on Wall Street and in Washington that the 
crisis could not have been foreseen or avoided there were warning signs The tragedy 
was that they were ignored or discounted There was an explosion in risky subprime 
lending and securitization an unsustainable rise in housing prices widespread reports 
of egregious and predatory lending practices dramatic increases in household 
mortgage debt and exponential growth in financial firms trading activities unregulated 
derivatives and short term  repo lending markets among many other red 
flags Yet there was pervasive permissiveness little meaningful action was taken to 
quell the threats in a timely manner 

The prime example is the Federal Reserves pivotal failure to stem the flow of toxic 
mortgages which it could have done by setting prudent mortgage lending standards 
The Federal Reserve was the one entity empowered to do so and it did not The 
record of our examination is replete with evidence of other failures financial institutions 
made bought and sold mortgage securities they never examined did not care 
to examine or knew to be defective firms depended on tens of billions of dollars of 
borrowing that had to be renewed each and every night secured by subprime mortgage 
securities and major firms and investors blindly relied on credit rating agencies 
as their arbiters of risk What else could one expect on a highway where there were 
neither speed limits nor neatly painted lines  

We conclude widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision 
proved devastating to the stability of the nations financial markets The sentries 
were not at their posts in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self 
correcting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively 
police themselves More than years of deregulation and reliance on self regulation 
by financial institutions championed by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan 
Greenspan and others supported by successive administrations and Congresses and 
actively pushed by the powerful financial industry at every turn had stripped away 
key safeguards which could have helped avoid catastrophe This approach had 
opened up gaps in oversight of critical areas with trillions of dollars at risk such as 
the shadow banking system and over the counter derivatives markets In addition 
the government permitted financial firms to pick their preferred regulators in what 
became a race to the weakest supervisor 
Yet we do not accept the view that regulators lacked the power to protect the financial 
system They had ample power in many arenas and they chose not to use it 
To give just three examples the Securities and Exchange Commission could have required 
more capital and halted risky practices at the big investment banks It did not 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other regulators could have clamped 
down on Citigroups excesses in the run up to the crisis They did not Policy makers 
and regulators could have stopped the runaway mortgage securitization train They 
did not In case after case after case regulators continued to rate the institutions they 
oversaw as safe and sound even in the face of mounting troubles often downgrading 
them just before their collapse And where regulators lacked authority they could 
have sought it Too often they lacked the political will in a political and ideological 
environment that constrained it as well as the fortitude to critically challenge the 
institutions and the entire system they were entrusted to oversee 

Changes in the regulatory system occurred in many instances as financial markets 
evolved But as the report will show the financial industry itself played a key 
role in weakening regulatory constraints on institutions markets and products It 
did not surprise the Commission that an industry of such wealth and power would 
exert pressure on policy makers and regulators From to the financial 
sector expended billion in reported federal lobbying expenses individuals and 
political action committees in the sector made more than billion in campaign 
contributions What troubled us was the extent to which the nation was deprived of 
the necessary strength and independence of the oversight necessary to safeguard 
financial stability 

We conclude dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management 
at many systemically important financial institutions were a key cause of this crisis 
There was a view that instincts for self preservation inside major financial firms 
would shield them from fatal risk taking without the need for a steady regulatory 
hand which the firms argued would stifle innovation Too many of these institutions 
acted recklessly taking on too much risk with too little capital and with too 
much dependence on short term funding In many respects this reflected a fundamental
change in these institutions particularly the large investment banks and bank 
holding companies which focused their activities increasingly on risky trading activities 
that produced hefty profits They took on enormous exposures in acquiring and 
supporting subprime lenders and creating packaging repackaging and selling trillions 
of dollars in mortgage related securities including synthetic financial products 
Like Icarus they never feared flying ever closer to the sun 

Many of these institutions grew aggressively through poorly executed acquisition 
and integration strategies that made effective management more challenging The 
CEO of Citigroup told the Commission that a billion position in highly rated 
mortgage securities would  not in any way have excited my attention  and the cohead 
of Citigroups investment bank said he spent  a small fraction of  of his time 
on those securities In this instance too big to fail meant too big to manage 

Financial institutions and credit rating agencies embraced mathematical models 
as reliable predictors of risks replacing judgment in too many instances Too often 
risk management became risk justification 

Compensation systems designed in an environment of cheap money intense 
competition and light regulation too often rewarded the quick deal the short term 
gain without proper consideration of long term consequences Often those systems 
encouraged the big bet where the payoff on the upside could be huge and the downside 
limited This was the case up and down the line from the corporate boardroom 
to the mortgage broker on the street 

Our examination revealed stunning instances of governance breakdowns and irresponsibility 
You will read among other things about AIG senior managements ignorance 
of the terms and risks of the companys billion derivatives exposure to 
mortgage related securities Fannie Maes quest for bigger market share profits and 
bonuses which led it to ramp up its exposure to risky loans and securities as the housing 
market was peaking and the costly surprise when Merrill Lynchs top management 
realized that the company held billion in  super senior and supposedly 
 super safe mortgage related securities that resulted in billions of dollars in losses 

We conclude a combination of excessive borrowing risky investments and lack 
of transparency put the financial system on a collision course with crisis Clearly 
this vulnerability was related to failures of corporate governance and regulation but 
it is significant enough by itself to warrant our attention here 
In the years leading up to the crisis too many financial institutions as well as too 
many households borrowed to the hilt leaving them vulnerable to financial distress 
or ruin if the value of their investments declined even modestly For example as of 
 the five major investment banks Bear Stearns Goldman Sachs Lehman 
Brothers Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were operating with extraordinarily 
thin capital By one measure their leverage ratios were as high as to meaning for 
every in assets there was only in capital to cover losses Less than a drop in 
asset values could wipe out a firm To make matters worse much of their borrowing 
was short term in the overnight market meaning the borrowing had to be renewed 
each and every day For example at the end of Bear Stearns had billion in 
equity and billion in liabilities and was borrowing as much as billion in 
the overnight market It was the equivalent of a small business with in equity 
borrowing million with of that due each and every day One cant 
really ask  What were they thinking  when it seems that too many of them were 
thinking alike 

And the leverage was often hidden in derivatives positions in off balance sheet 
entities and through  window dressing of financial reports available to the investing 
public 

The kings of leverage were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the two behemoth government 
sponsored enterprises GSEs For example by the end of Fannies 
and Freddies combined leverage ratio including loans they owned and guaranteed 
stood at to 

But financial firms were not alone in the borrowing spree from to national 
mortgage debt almost doubled and the amount of mortgage debt per household 
rose more than from to even while wages were 
essentially stagnant When the housing downturn hit heavily indebted financial 
firms and families alike were walloped 

The heavy debt taken on by some financial institutions was exacerbated by the 
risky assets they were acquiring with that debt As the mortgage and real estate markets 
churned out riskier and riskier loans and securities many financial institutions 
loaded up on them By the end of Lehman had amassed billion in commercial 
and residential real estate holdings and securities which was almost twice 
what it held just two years before and more than four times its total equity And 
again the risk wasn’t being taken on just by the big financial firms but by families 
too Nearly one in mortgage borrowers in and took out  option ARM 
loans which meant they could choose to make payments so low that their mortgage 
balances rose every month 

Within the financial system the dangers of this debt were magnified because 
transparency was not required or desired Massive short term borrowing combined 
with obligations unseen by others in the market heightened the chances the system 
could rapidly unravel In the early part of the th century we erected a series of protections 
the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort federal deposit insurance ample 
regulations to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued 
Americas banking system in the th century Yet over the past  plus years we 
permitted the growth of a shadow banking system opaque and laden with short 
term debt that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system Key components 
of the market for example the multitrillion dollar repo lending market off balance 
sheet entities and the use of over the counter derivatives were hidden from 
view without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns We 
had a st century financial system with th century safeguards 

When the housing and mortgage markets cratered the lack of transparency the 
extraordinary debt loads the short term loans and the risky assets all came home to 
roost What resulted was panic We had reaped what we had sown 

We conclude the government was ill prepared for the crisis and its inconsistent 
response added to the uncertainty and panic in the financial markets As part of 
our charge it was appropriate to review government actions taken in response to the 
developing crisis not just those policies or actions that preceded it to determine if 
any of those responses contributed to or exacerbated the crisis 
As our report shows key policy makers the Treasury Department the Federal 
Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who were best positioned 
to watch over our markets were ill prepared for the events of and 
Other agencies were also behind the curve They were hampered because they did 
not have a clear grasp of the financial system they were charged with overseeing particularly 
as it had evolved in the years leading up to the crisis This was in no small 
measure due to the lack of transparency in key markets They thought risk had been 
diversified when in fact it had been concentrated Time and again from the spring 
of on policy makers and regulators were caught off guard as the contagion 
spread responding on an ad hoc basis with specific programs to put fingers in the 
dike There was no comprehensive and strategic plan for containment because they 
lacked a full understanding of the risks and interconnections in the financial markets 
Some regulators have conceded this error We had allowed the system to race 
ahead of our ability to protect it 

While there was some awareness of or at least a debate about the housing bubble 
the record reflects that senior public officials did not recognize that a bursting of the 
bubble could threaten the entire financial system Throughout the summer of 
both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paul 
son offered public assurances that the turmoil in the subprime mortgage markets 
would be contained When Bear Stearnss hedge funds which were heavily invested 
in mortgage related securities imploded in June the Federal Reserve discussed 
the implications of the collapse Despite the fact that so many other funds were exposed 
to the same risks as those hedge funds the Bear Stearns funds were thought to 
be  relatively unique  Days before the collapse of Bear Stearns in March SEC 
Chairman Christopher Cox expressed  comfort about the capital cushions at the big 
investment banks It was not until August just weeks before the government 
takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that the Treasury Department understood 
the full measure of the dire financial conditions of those two institutions And just a 
month before Lehmans collapse the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was still 
seeking information on the exposures created by Lehmans more than derivatives 
contracts 

In addition the governments inconsistent handling of major financial institutions 
during the crisis the decision to rescue Bear Stearns and then to place Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac into conservatorship followed by its decision not to save Lehman 
Brothers and then to save AIG increased uncertainty and panic in the market 

In making these observations we deeply respect and appreciate the efforts made 
by Secretary Paulson Chairman Bernanke and Timothy Geithner formerly president 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and now treasury secretary and so 
many others who labored to stabilize our financial system and our economy in the 
most chaotic and challenging of circumstances 

We conclude there was a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics The 
integrity of our financial markets and the publics trust in those markets are essential 
to the economic well being of our nation The soundness and the sustained prosperity 
of the financial system and our economy rely on the notions of fair dealing responsibility 
and transparency In our economy we expect businesses and individuals 
to pursue profits at the same time that they produce products and services of quality 
and conduct themselves well 
Unfortunately as has been the case in past speculative booms and busts we 
witnessed an erosion of standards of responsibility and ethics that exacerbated the financial 
crisis This was not universal but these breaches stretched from the ground 
level to the corporate suites They resulted not only in significant financial consequences 
but also in damage to the trust of investors businesses and the public in the 
financial system 

For example our examination found according to one measure that the percentage 
of borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages within just a matter of months 
after taking a loan nearly doubled from the summer of to late This data 
indicates they likely took out mortgages that they never had the capacity or intention 
to pay You will read about mortgage brokers who were paid  yield spread premiums 
by lenders to put borrowers into higher cost loans so they would get bigger fees often 
never disclosed to borrowers The report catalogues the rising incidence of mortgage 
fraud which flourished in an environment of collapsing lending standards and 
lax regulation The number of suspicious activity reports reports of possible financial 
crimes filed by depository banks and their affiliates related to mortgage fraud 
grew  fold between and and then more than doubled again between 
 and One study places the losses resulting from fraud on mortgage loans 
made between and at billion 

Lenders made loans that they knew borrowers could not afford and that could 
cause massive losses to investors in mortgage securities As early as September 
Countrywide executives recognized that many of the loans they were originating 
could result in  catastrophic consequences  Less than a year later they noted that 
certain high risk loans they were making could result not only in foreclosures but 
also in  financial and reputational catastrophe for the firm But they did not stop 

And the report documents that major financial institutions ineffectively sampled 
loans they were purchasing to package and sell to investors They knew a significant 
percentage of the sampled loans did not meet their own underwriting standards or 
those of the originators Nonetheless they sold those securities to investors The 
Commissions review of many prospectuses provided to investors found that this critical 
information was not disclosed 

THESE CONCLUSIONS must be viewed in the context of human nature and individual 
and societal responsibility First to pin this crisis on mortal flaws like greed and 
hubris would be simplistic It was the failure to account for human weakness that is 
relevant to this crisis 

Second we clearly believe the crisis was a result of human mistakes misjudgments 
and misdeeds that resulted in systemic failures for which our nation has paid 
dearly As you read this report you will see that specific firms and individuals acted 
irresponsibly Yet a crisis of this magnitude cannot be the work of a few bad actors 
and such was not the case here At the same time the breadth of this crisis does not 
mean that  everyone is at fault many firms and individuals did not participate in the 
excesses that spawned disaster 

We do place special responsibility with the public leaders charged with protecting 
our financial system those entrusted to run our regulatory agencies and the chief executives 
of companies whose failures drove us to crisis These individuals sought and 
accepted positions of significant responsibility and obligation Tone at the top does 
matter and in this instance we were let down No one said  no  

But as a nation we must also accept responsibility for what we permitted to occur 
Collectively but certainly not unanimously we acquiesced to or embraced a system 
a set of policies and actions that gave rise to our present predicament 



THIS REPORT DESCRIBES THE EVENTS and the system that propelled our nation toward 
crisis The complex machinery of our financial markets has many essential 
gears some of which played a critical role as the crisis developed and deepened 
Here we render our conclusions about specific components of the system that we believe 
contributed significantly to the financial meltdown 

We conclude collapsing mortgage lending standards and the mortgage securitization 
pipeline lit and spread the flame of contagion and crisis When housing 
prices fell and mortgage borrowers defaulted the lights began to dim on Wall Street 
This report catalogues the corrosion of mortgage lending standards and the securitization 
pipeline that transported toxic mortgages from neighborhoods across America 
to investors around the globe 
Many mortgage lenders set the bar so low that lenders simply took eager borrowers 
qualifications on faith often with a willful disregard for a borrowers ability to 
pay Nearly one quarter of all mortgages made in the first half of were interest 
only loans During the same year of  option ARM loans originated by Countrywide 
and Washington Mutual had low  or no documentation requirements 

These trends were not secret As irresponsible lending including predatory and 
fraudulent practices became more prevalent the Federal Reserve and other regulators 
and authorities heard warnings from many quarters Yet the Federal Reserve 
neglected its mission  to ensure the safety and soundness of the nations banking and 
financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers  It failed to build the 
retaining wall before it was too late And the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
and the Office of Thrift Supervision caught up in turf wars preempted state 
regulators from reining in abuses 

While many of these mortgages were kept on banks books the bigger money came 
from global investors who clamored to put their cash into newly created mortgage related 
securities It appeared to financial institutions investors and regulators alike that 
risk had been conquered the investors held highly rated securities they thought were 
sure to perform the banks thought they had taken the riskiest loans off their books 
and regulators saw firms making profits and borrowing costs reduced But each step in 
the mortgage securitization pipeline depended on the next step to keep demand going 
From the speculators who flipped houses to the mortgage brokers who scouted 
the loans to the lenders who issued the mortgages to the financial firms that created 
the mortgage backed securities collateralized debt obligations CDOs CDOs 
squared and synthetic CDOs no one in this pipeline of toxic mortgages had enough 
skin in the game They all believed they could off load their risks on a moments notice 
to the next person in line They were wrong When borrowers stopped making 
mortgage payments the losses amplified by derivatives rushed through the 
pipeline As it turned out these losses were concentrated in a set of systemically important 
financial institutions 

In the end the system that created millions of mortgages so efficiently has proven 
to be difficult to unwind Its complexity has erected barriers to modifying mortgages 
so families can stay in their homes and has created further uncertainty about the 
health of the housing market and financial institutions 

We conclude over the counter derivatives contributed significantly to this 
crisis The enactment of legislation in to ban the regulation by both the federal 
and state governments of over the counter OTC derivatives was a key turning 
point in the march toward the financial crisis 
From financial firms to corporations to farmers and to investors derivatives 
have been used to hedge against or speculate on changes in prices rates or indices 
or even on events such as the potential defaults on debts Yet without any oversight 
OTC derivatives rapidly spiraled out of control and out of sight growing to trillion 
in notional amount This report explains the uncontrolled leverage lack of 
transparency capital and collateral requirements speculation interconnections 
among firms and concentrations of risk in this market 

OTC derivatives contributed to the crisis in three significant ways First one type 
of derivative credit default swaps CDS  fueled the mortgage securitization 
pipeline CDS were sold to investors to protect against the default or decline in value 
of mortgage related securities backed by risky loans Companies sold protection to 
the tune of billion in AIGs case to investors in these newfangled mortgage securities 
helping to launch and expand the market and in turn to further fuel the 
housing bubble 

Second CDS were essential to the creation of synthetic CDOs These synthetic 
CDOs were merely bets on the performance of real mortgage related securities They 
amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets 
on the same securities and helped spread them throughout the financial system 
Goldman Sachs alone packaged and sold billion in synthetic CDOs from July 
 to May Synthetic CDOs created by Goldman referenced more than 
 mortgage securities and of them were referenced at least twice This is 
apart from how many times these securities may have been referenced in synthetic 
CDOs created by other firms 

Finally when the housing bubble popped and crisis followed derivatives were in 
the center of the storm AIG which had not been required to put aside capital reserves 
as a cushion for the protection it was selling was bailed out when it could not 
meet its obligations The government ultimately committed more than billion 
because of concerns that AIGs collapse would trigger cascading losses throughout 
the global financial system In addition the existence of millions of derivatives contracts 
of all types between systemically important financial institutions unseen and 
unknown in this unregulated market added to uncertainty and escalated panic 
helping to precipitate government assistance to those institutions 

We conclude the failures of credit rating agencies were essential cogs in the 
wheel of financial destruction The three credit rating agencies were key enablers of 
the financial meltdown The mortgage related securities at the heart of the crisis 
could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval Investors relied 
on them often blindly In some cases they were obligated to use them or regulatory 
capital standards were hinged on them This crisis could not have happened 
without the rating agencies Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades 
through and wreaked havoc across markets and firms 
In our report you will read about the breakdowns at Moodys examined by the 
Commission as a case study From to Moodys rated nearly 
mortgage related securities as triple A This compares with six private sector companies 
in the United States that carried this coveted rating in early In 
alone Moodys put its triple A stamp of approval on mortgage related securities 
every working day The results were disastrous of the mortgage securities rated 
triple A that year ultimately were downgraded 

You will also read about the forces at work behind the breakdowns at Moodys including 
the flawed computer models the pressure from financial firms that paid for 
the ratings the relentless drive for market share the lack of resources to do the job 
despite record profits and the absence of meaningful public oversight And you will 
see that without the active participation of the rating agencies the market for mortgage 
related securities could not have been what it became 



THERE ARE MANY COMPETING VIEWS as to the causes of this crisis In this regard the 
Commission has endeavored to address key questions posed to us Here we discuss 
three capital availability and excess liquidity the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
 the GSEs and government housing policy 

First as to the matter of excess liquidity in our report we outline monetary policies 
and capital flows during the years leading up to the crisis Low interest rates 
widely available capital and international investors seeking to put their money in real 
estate assets in the United States were prerequisites for the creation of a credit bubble 
Those conditions created increased risks which should have been recognized by 
market participants policy makers and regulators However it is the Commissions 
conclusion that excess liquidity did not need to cause a crisis It was the failures outlined 
above including the failure to effectively rein in excesses in the mortgage and 
financial markets that were the principal causes of this crisis Indeed the availability 
of well priced capital both foreign and domestic is an opportunity for economic 
expansion and growth if encouraged to flow in productive directions 

Second we examined the role of the GSEs with Fannie Mae serving as the Commissions 
case study in this area These government sponsored enterprises had a 
deeply flawed business model as publicly traded corporations with the implicit backing 
of and subsidies from the federal government and with a public mission Their 
 trillion mortgage exposure and market position were significant In and 
 they decided to ramp up their purchase and guarantee of risky mortgages just 
as the housing market was peaking They used their political power for decades to 
ward off effective regulation and oversight spending million on lobbying from 
 to They suffered from many of the same failures of corporate governance 
and risk management as the Commission discovered in other financial firms 
Through the third quarter of the Treasury Department had provided billion 
in financial support to keep them afloat 

We conclude that these two entities contributed to the crisis but were not a primary 
cause Importantly GSE mortgage securities essentially maintained their value 
throughout the crisis and did not contribute to the significant financial firm losses 
that were central to the financial crisis 

The GSEs participated in the expansion of subprime and other risky mortgages 
but they followed rather than led Wall Street and other lenders in the rush for fools 
gold They purchased the highest rated non GSE mortgage backed securities and 
their participation in this market added helium to the housing balloon but their purchases 
never represented a majority of the market Those purchases represented 
of non GSE subprime mortgage backed securities in with the share rising to 
 in and falling back to by They relaxed their underwriting standards 
to purchase or guarantee riskier loans and related securities in order to meet 
stock market analysts and investors expectations for growth to regain market share 
and to ensure generous compensation for their executives and employees justifying 
their activities on the broad and sustained public policy support for homeownership 

The Commission also probed the performance of the loans purchased or guaranteed 
by Fannie and Freddie While they generated substantial losses delinquency 
rates for GSE loans were substantially lower than loans securitized by other financial 
firms For example data compiled by the Commission for a subset of borrowers with 
similar credit scores  scores below   show that by the end of GSE mortgages 
were far less likely to be seriously delinquent than were non GSE securitized 
mortgages versus 

We also studied at length how the Department of Housing and Urban Developments 
 HUDs affordable housing goals for the GSEs affected their investment in 
risky mortgages Based on the evidence and interviews with dozens of individuals involved 
in this subject area we determined these goals only contributed marginally to 
Fannies and Freddies participation in those mortgages 

Finally as to the matter of whether government housing policies were a primary 
cause of the crisis for decades government policy has encouraged homeownership 
through a set of incentives assistance programs and mandates These policies were 
put in place and promoted by several administrations and Congresses indeed both 
Presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush set aggressive goals to increase home 
ownership 

In conducting our inquiry we took a careful look at HUDs affordable housing 
goals as noted above and the Community Reinvestment Act CRA The CRA was 
enacted in to combat  redlining by banks the practice of denying credit to individuals 
and businesses in certain neighborhoods without regard to their creditworthiness 
The CRA requires banks and savings and loans to lend invest and provide 
services to the communities from which they take deposits consistent with bank 
safety and soundness 

The Commission concludes the CRA was not a significant factor in subprime lending 
or the crisis Many subprime lenders were not subject to the CRA Research indicates
only of high cost loans a proxy for subprime loans had any connection to 
the law Loans made by CRA regulated lenders in the neighborhoods in which they 
were required to lend were half as likely to default as similar loans made in the same 
neighborhoods by independent mortgage originators not subject to the law 

Nonetheless we make the following observation about government housing policies 
they failed in this respect As a nation we set aggressive homeownership goals 
with the desire to extend credit to families previously denied access to the financial 
markets Yet the government failed to ensure that the philosophy of opportunity was 
being matched by the practical realities on the ground Witness again the failure of 
the Federal Reserve and other regulators to rein in irresponsible lending Homeownership 
peaked in the spring of and then began to decline From that point on 
the talk of opportunity was tragically at odds with the reality of a financial disaster in 
the making 



WHEN THIS COMMISSION began its work months ago some imagined that the 
events of and their consequences would be well behind us by the time we issued 
this report Yet more than two years after the federal government intervened in an 
unprecedented manner in our financial markets our country finds itself still grappling 
with the aftereffects of the calamity Our financial system is in many respects 
still unchanged from what existed on the eve of the crisis Indeed in the wake of the 
crisis the U S financial sector is now more concentrated than ever in the hands of a 
few large systemically significant institutions 

While we have not been charged with making policy recommendations the very 
purpose of our report has been to take stock of what happened so we can plot a new 
course In our inquiry we found dramatic breakdowns of corporate governance 
profound lapses in regulatory oversight and near fatal flaws in our financial system 
We also found that a series of choices and actions led us toward a catastrophe for 
which we were ill prepared These are serious matters that must be addressed and 
resolved to restore faith in our financial markets to avoid the next crisis and to rebuild 
a system of capital that provides the foundation for a new era of broadly 
shared prosperity 

The greatest tragedy would be to accept the refrain that no one could have seen 
this coming and thus nothing could have been done If we accept this notion it will 
happen again 

This report should not be viewed as the end of the nations examination of this 
crisis There is still much to learn much to investigate and much to fix 

This is our collective responsibility It falls to us to make different choices if we 
want different results

I SUMMARY
This report provides an analysis of the United States Postal
Services current legal authority to introduce and provide new
products and services and enter into negotiated service
agreements with individual customers This report also includes
background on the use of such authority within the past two
years 
The Commissions analysis of existing postal law yields the
following conclusions 


 
The Postal Reorganization Act of gives the United
States Postal Service a clear mandate to innovate by developing
effective and efficient services adapted to the needs of the
Nations mail users 


 
The mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic
mail services is the joint authority shared by the Postal Service
and the Postal Rate Commission to adopt new mail classifications
under U S C §§ through 


 
The Postal Rate Commission has developed specialized
procedural rules that provide for expeditious consideration of
proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due
process rights of other interested persons 


 
Negotiated Service Agreements NSAs or  niche
classifications  are rate and service adjustments arranged by the
Postal Service and potential users that are legally permissible 
provided that 


❶ The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding as the
Reorganization Act requires 
❷ The agreed upon rate and service changes will work to the
mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole 
and
❸ The negotiated rate and service package is made available on
the same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same
conditions of service 


II BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF ANALYSIS
In joint deliberations on appropriations for the United States
Postal Service and certain other agencies and departments for
Fiscal Year the committee of conference directed both the
Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to prepare reports on
particular areas of the Postal Services authority under existing
law Specifically the conferees directed 
 both the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate
Commission to independently report days after enactment of this
Act on the scope of existing authority of the US Postal Service 
under title United States Code and title Code of Federal
Regulations to introduce and provide new products and services
 including the introduction and provision of new products and
service on an experimental or market test basis and to enter into
negotiated service agreements with individual customers or groups
of customers Such reports shall include background on the use of
such authority within the past months and shall be provided to
the Committees on Appropriations the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government
Reform 
H R CONF REP NO   th Cong st Sess 
As directed the Commission submits this report to the Senate and
House of Representatives Committees on Appropriations the Senate
Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on
Government Reform 
The report is presented in three sections The first outlines
the Postal Services current legal authority to introduce new
products and services the role of the Postal Rate Commission in
that process and the procedural mechanisms available for expedited
approval of such innovations The second section addresses the same
topics in connection with Negotiated Service Agreements NSAs 
so called  niche classifications   which are special service and
rate arrangements negotiated between the Postal Service and a
particular mailer or groups of mailers with features tailored to
their use of the postal system Finally an appendix to the report
summarizes recent
 The amended bill produced by the conference committee was
enacted as Pub L No   Stat 
Commission proceedings in which the Postal Service has sought to
introduce service innovations some of them customized for
particular groups of mailers on an expedited basis 
III POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP INTRODUCE AND PROVIDE
NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES


A Innovation under the Postal Reorganization Act
While pre existing law afforded limited opportunities for postal
innovation the Postal Reorganization Act of gave the
newly created United States Postal Service a clear mandate to
innovate by developing effective and efficient services adapted to
the needs of the Nations mail users Section a of Title 
establishes the Postal Services paramount obligation  to provide
postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal 
educational literary and business correspondence of the people  
The same section establishes the performance criterion that the
Postal Service is expected to achieve as a matter of postal policy 
 It shall provide prompt reliable and efficient services to
patrons in all areas and all communities   Similarly §
 a assigns the Postal Service the duty to  plan develop 
promote and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fair
and reasonable rates and fees   The Act fosters service innovation
by assigning the Postal Service responsibility  to provide types of
mail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and
mail users   
U S C § b 
The Reorganization Act grants the Postal Service specific powers
that serve as the operational tools of service innovation Section
 of Title grants the Postal Service plenary authority over
custody of the mail and its movement § a over the
deployment of post offices other facilities and equipment §
 a and over the means by which stamps and other postage
are sold § a and The same section also authorizes
the Postal Service  to provide establish change or abolish
special nonpostal or similar services   U S C §
 a 
Conclusion The Postal Reorganization Act of clearly
mandates that the Postal Service innovate by developing effective
and efficient postal services adapted to the needs of the Nations
mail users 
 Former U S C § a authorized the Postmaster General to
maintain a research and development program and to conduct
experiments to enhance the operational efficiency and economy of
the postal system 


B Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail
Classifications
Prior to the array of mail services provided by the Post
Office Department was codified as part of Title The
Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal
services with an administrative process in which the Governors of
the Postal Service establish and the Postal Rate Commission
reviews proposed changes in the terms and conditions of postal
services which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification
Schedule or  DMCS  
Section of Title provides that  the Governors are
authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail 
 in accordance with the provisions of this chapter   Section
 a directs the Postal Service to file a request with the
Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a
mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization
Acts effective date The Postal Service complied with this
requirement early in and a Domestic Mail Classification
Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 
 
Following establishment of this initial mail classification
schedule § b provides that the Postal Service  may from time
to time request that the Commission submit or the Commission may
submit to the Governors on its own initiative a recommended
decision on changes in the mail classification schedule  
Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow
proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is
afforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required to
represent the interests of the general public U S C § a 
The Commissions procedural rules governing proposed changes in the
mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 
of the Code of Federal Regulations 
C F R § et seq 
 See former Title Part IV Mail Matter 
 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is
published as Appendix A to Subpart C of C F R Part 
following C F R § 
 Docket No MC   Phase I Opinion and Recommended Decision 
April accepted in Decision of the Governors of the United
States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification
Schedule June 
Over the past years the Postal Service has filed many such
mail classification requests with the Commission seeking either to
establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre existing
services Less frequently the Commission has begun proceedings on
its own initiative most commonly in response to a mail users
request to do so Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer
useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal
services 
Conclusion The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and
the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt
new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing
innovations in domestic mail service 
C Commission Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious
Consideration of Proposed Service Innovations
Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations
merit consideration under specialized procedures the Commission
has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined
categories of Postal Service requests The rules depart from those
generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by
reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is
required to produce and by expediting the Commissions procedural
schedule for considering the particular form of proposed
change 
The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was
a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail
classification requests involving proposed new services or changes
in existing services that were intended to serve as experiments 
The rules contained in C F R §§ through d provide
a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial type hearing
is required allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability
of data that would otherwise have to be filed and provide for data
collection for the duration of the experiment The experimental
rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of days from the
Commissions determination that the proposed change is experimental
in nature 
These rules were not used extensively A joint Postal
Service Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of
areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal
Service innovation The Postal Service petitioned the Commission
in to adopt rules to implement some of the task forces
recommendations The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider
the rules proposed in the Services petition and after considering
the comments of interested parties implemented four of the
proposed initiatives albeit in revised form 
Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures
for particular categories of Postal Service requests The fourth
set specifies conditions under which the Service may use multi year
test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become
compensatory over time 
The first set of these new procedural rules incorporated into
the Commissions rules of practice as sections through 
establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service
proposed market tests of potential new services The rules specify
the limited information the Service is required to file in support
of a proposed market test including a plan for testing the
proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting
requirements They also streamline public notice and hearing
procedures and provide for issuance of a  yes or no  Commission
decision on the proposed market test within days consistent
with the procedural due process rights of interested persons The
Postal Services innovative Mailing Online service for which a
three year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket
No MC   was initially considered and recommended by the
Commission under the market test rules See the Appendix to this
report under the heading for Docket No MC   
The second set of rules apply to Postal Service proposals to
implement new services that would supplement but not alter 
existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for
a limited time As in the market test rules the provisional
service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by
the Postal Service in addition they allow the Service to explain
why it should not be required to provide
 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change A Report by the
Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking June 
 C F R §§   
 C F R §§   
information called for in the Commissions general rules for
mail classification proposals The rules likewise expedite public
notice and procedural scheduling providing for a  yes or no 
Commission decision within days consistent with the due process
rights of other parties 
A third set of rules adopted as sections through c of the
rules of practice applies to Postal Service requests for
permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character 
 Minor  classification changes are defined as those that would not
change any existing rate or fee would not impose any new
restriction on eligibility for mailing and would not significantly
increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected
mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the
Postal Service The rules specify limited required supporting
information allow the Service to explain the unavailability of
otherwise required data and also streamline procedural scheduling 
Under these rules for minor classification proposals the
procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is days
from the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings are
held and days if hearings are scheduled in the case 
Finally the fourth set of rules contained in sections and
 of the rules of practice applies to Postal Service requests
for new services that it believes cannot recover all their
associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation 
In such instances the Services request must be supported by
testimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationale
for the proposed multi year test period The request should also
provide Return on Investment projections other available financial
analyses and cost revenue and volume estimates for the new
service for the entire proposed test period The rules establish a
policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years
for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced
postal services 
The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in to be
effective for a period of five years In light of their apparent
workability in several Commission proceedings and their continuing
usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the
 C F R §§   c C F R §§   
Postal Service the Commission extended their application for an
additional five year period in a recent rulemaking 
Conclusion Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of
procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to
provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations
in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all
interested persons

IV POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND
SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS
TO PROVIDE SERVICES
For a number of years some mailers have pursued the idea of
establishing customized postal rates and or terms of service
through negotiation with the Postal Service Depending on their
respective objectives and features contractual arrangements of
this kind have been labeled  contract rates    negotiated service
agreements   or more recently  niche classifications   In
addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current
law it is important to identify and consider all of their
characteristics For example the legality of an agreement may be
dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed
without any regulatory scrutiny or instead submitted for some form
of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its
effectiveness 
A Statutory Bases of Potential Authority
No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits
the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements
with mail users Section of Title generally empowers the
Service  to enter into and perform contracts   and there is no
prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users
negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of
service should be changed However other provisions in Title 
cast into doubt the conclusion that the Services authority under §
 is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail
classifications by agreement alone 
The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and
substantive From a procedural perspective the legal soundness of
rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful
because the only means of making such changes recognized in the
Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter of
Title These provisions require that rate or mail classification
changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request
with the Postal Rate Commission allowing for public scrutiny and
deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal
Service 
Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 
has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the
intended change 
Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the
substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications
in the Reorganization Act Section c of Title directs
that 
In providing services and in establishing classifications 
rates and fees under this title the Postal Service shall not 
except as specifically authorized in this title make any undue or
unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails nor shall it
grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user 
Sections and similarly specify fairness and equity 
together with other criteria as considerations to be observed in
making rate and mail classification changes Without public
scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service
agreement between the Postal Service and a customer there could be
no assurance that these substantive criteria would be
satisfied 
However assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter are
met changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for
their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable
statutory standards Section c directs the Commission to
consider  the desirability and justification for special
classifications and services of mail  § c and  the
desirability of special classifications from the point of view of
both the user and of the Postal Service  § c Regarding
rates § b establishes  the degree of preparation of mail
for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its
effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service  as a factor to be
considered in connection with a proposed change In combination
with other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Act 
these
 United Parcel Service v U S Postal Service F Supp 
 E D Pa affirmed F d d Cir cert 
denied U S 
considerations could support recommendation of rate and
classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of
particular mailers 
Conclusion Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal
Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the
procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal
Reorganization Act are satisfied 


B Problematical  Contract Rates 
In a rulemaking proceeding conducted in the late s at the
request of a mailer the Commission addressed the question of the
Postal Services authority to negotiate rate changes in the form of
a proposal to recognize  contract rates   After considering
comments of the Postal Service and other participants the
Commission found the proposal problematical and declined to pursue
it 
The initial proposal considered in Docket No RM   included
two variants 


 
The Commission might after considering cost and other
relevant evidence establish a range of permissible rates for
particular subclasses with the Postal Service and individual
mailers free thereafter to negotiate rates within this range 
or


 
The Postal Service and one or more mailers would
negotiate a rate and service package which would then i be
submitted to the Commission for a review and ii thereafter be
available on the same terms to all potential users 


The Commission solicited two rounds of comments on the proposal
from interested parties The proponent and one other mailer took
the position that the Postal Service is authorized to enter into
such contracts provided the procedural requirement of review under
Chapter is observed Other commenters including the Commissions
Office of Consumer Advocate expressed doubts regarding the legal
soundness of one or both of the proposed variants of such
agreements The Postal Service commented that in its view legal
constraints would not preclude a contract mechanism in principle 
but that no such arrangement would be permissible without the
Commissions participation in accordance with U S C §§ 
through 
Upon consideration of the initial comments it received the
Commission declined to pursue the contract rate proposal but
solicited further comments on several broad issues concerning
possible changes in the mail classification system The Commission
explained that its reluctance to pursue the concept of contract
rates was based on substantial uncertainty regarding the legal
sufficiency of examining agreed upon rates after the fact rather
than in a prior review It also raised the potential problems of
unreasonable discrimination that such contracts might cause in
contravention of 
U S C § c and the preservation of fair contributions to
the Postal Services institutional costs by mail volumes Such
problems might well arise if the Service were to negotiate
 discounted  rates unaccompanied by a change in service conditions
that provided cost or revenue justification 
Conclusion Negotiated rates unaccompanied by a change in
service conditions that provides cost justification are a
problematical approach to introducing additional flexibility into
Postal Service business practices 


C Negotiated Service Agreements and Specialized  Niche
Classifications 
Following publication of the report of the joint Postal
Service Postal Rate Commission task force on ratemaking the Postal
Service petitioned the Commission to adopt rules to implement some
of the reports recommendations One recommendation included in the
Services petition was adoption of Commission rules for reviewing
on an expedited basis  service agreements with postal customers 
varying from the general rate and classifications schedules in ways
which add value both for the customer and for the postal system as
a whole   
The proposal in the Postal Services petition would have
established Negotiated Service Agreements as a new form of mail
classification with individual agreements to be reviewed by the
Commission within days In the Commissions Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking it deferred consideration of the NSA proposal citing
legal uncertainty regarding the consistency of negotiated rates
with the Reorganization Acts
 Docket No RM   Further Invitation for Comments Fed 
Reg Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change supra 
at 
ratemaking provisions However the Commission also expressed a
general willingness to address the concept in a subsequent
rulemaking 
Since then the Commission has conducted several mail
classification proceedings under the other expedited procedures
adopted in that rulemaking These procedures have been shown to be
well suited to the consideration of  niche classification 
proposals Niche classifications are specialized mail
classifications  including reduced but cost justified rates or
fees that have been developed by the Postal Service in direct
consultation with its customers to meet the needs and capabilities
of a mailer or group of mailers For example the Commission
approved a two year experiment of a program that enabled users of
bulk nonletter size Business Reply Mail such as photofinishers
that could reliably determine postage and fees due to obtain
earlier access to their mail at revised fees The Commission
subsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment and
ultimately approved a request to make the experimental program a
permanent mail classification More recently in Docket No 
MC   the Commission recommended three new worksharing based
discounted Priority Mail categories after negotiating with mailers
who were willing to presort their mail in new ways that could
reduce the Postal Services costs Such  niche classification 
proposals are essentially Negotiated Service Agreements without
any associated legal uncertainties or additional administrative
barriers 
Conclusion Rate and service adjustments agreed upon by the
Postal Service and mailers are legally authorized if three
conditions are satisfied 
❶ The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding as the
Reorganization Act requires 
❷ The agreed upon rate and service changes will work to the
mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole

Attached you will find a document entitled  Access to Records  
This document summarizes LSC managements internal practices with
respect to accessing information contained in records maintained by
LSC recipients LSC management prides itself on thorough and
effective monitoring of recipient activities and on its training of
recipients with regard to compliance issues 
Of particular importance however are the methods for ensuring
that LSC obtain necessary access to information in ways that ensure
full compliance consistent with its statutory obligations Congress
has mandated that LSC effectively monitor and audit its grant
recipients and that LSC respect attorney client privilege and
ensure that LSC recipients carry out their work consistent with
their professional responsibilities 
Please note that the statement of practices appended hereto as
 Access to Records  does not and is not intended to waive or alter
any of LSCs rights to documents and other information and does not
apply to audits investigations and other OIG activities 
The Protocol is intended to set forth LSCs policy with respect
to accessing grant recipients files and to facilitate better
communication and understanding on this topic With appropriate
notice to the Board and LSC grant recipients LSCs President may
change or alter this Protocol as circumstances warrant 
ACCESS TO RECORDS

April 
This document sets forth procedures to be used by LSCs Office
of Compliance and Enforcement OCE and Office of Program
Performance OPP when making requests to review documents that
contain information about clients and their cases that may be
protected from disclosure to LSC by the attorney client privilege
or the rules of professional responsibility 

STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
LSC has the statutory responsibility to ensure that recipients
comply with the provisions of the LSC Act and regulations and any
other laws including appropriation provisions which apply to LSC
funds or recipients See Section b A LSC is given
explicit authority  to prescribe the keeping of records with
respect to funds provided by grant or contract and shall have
access to such records at all reasonable times for the purpose of
insuring compliance with the grant or contract or the terms and
conditions upon which financial assistance was provided   See
Section b 
However the LSC Act recognizes that some records contain
information that is protected by the attorney client privilege
and or attorneys ethical responsibilities under rules of
professional responsibility Section d of the LSC Act
explicitly provides that  neither the Corporation nor the
Comptroller General shall have access to any reports or records
subject to the attorneyclient privilege   In addition section
 b includes both a prohibition that LSC  shall not under
any provision of this title interfere with any attorney in
carrying out his professional responsibilities  and also imposes an
affirmative duty that LSC  shall ensure that activities under this
title are carried out in a manner consistent with attorneys
professional responsibilities  
Section h of the LSC appropriation which has been
reenacted in each subsequent year provides that notwithstanding
section b LSC auditors and monitors are given explicit
access to  financial records time records retainer agreements 
client trust fund and eligibility records and client names for
each recipient   except for reports or records subject to the
attorney client privilege   See United States v Legal Services of
New York City F d D C Cir In addition section
 a of the LSC appropriation authorizes LSC access to
the client  statement of facts   Disclosure of information not
required by these sections of the appropriation provisions is
governed by sections b and d of the LSC Act 


PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to inform LSC recipients and
other interested parties of the procedure for providing LSC access
to records in a manner consistent with the attorney client
privilege and applicable rules of professional responsibility and
the mechanism to resolve issues of how such access can be
obtained 


GENERAL PRINCIPLES
LSC will act to carry out its statutory responsibilities to
ensure compliance with the LSC Act appropriation provisions and
any other provisions of law and will do so consistent with the
statutory provisions on both privileged and confidential
information 
LSC recipients are obligated to provide information to LSC under
the applicable LSC statutes regulations grant terms grant
assurances and other rules and provisions regarding the receipt
and use of LSC funds For example upon request recipients must
provide LSC access to all records specified in section h 
unless as provided in section h the information sought is
protected by the attorney client privilege In addition upon
request recipients must also provide LSC access to original
unredacted client  statement of facts   as required by CFR
§ Recipients and LSC will work together in good faith
regarding issues of access to records that may contain information
protected by rules of professional responsibility or the law on
attorney client privilege 


PROCEDURES


 
Applicability This procedure applies to requests by the
Office of Compliance and Enforcement OCE or the Office of Program
Performance OPP for access to records of a recipient that may
include information that may be protected by rules of professional
responsibility or the law on attorney client privilege Such
information will hereafter be referred to as privileged or
confidential information As applied to OPP references to OCE and
the Vice President for Administration shall be to OPP and the Vice
President for Programs 


 
Notice to the Recipient Whenever OCE proposes to review
the records of a recipient either through an on site visit or
otherwise OCE notifies the recipient orally and in writing about
the purpose of the visit or review what activities OCE will
conduct and what specific information and records are planned to
be within the scope of the review Each review is an ongoing
process that may expand based on information reviewed As such OCE
will notify the recipient orally and in writing when the scope of
the review has changed or expanded and what information and records
are further required 


 
Use of Intermediaries In all written and oral
communications with recipients OCE will affirmatively propose that
recipients use program staff as an intermediary to review case
files or other records containing privileged or confidential
information and to answer questions of OCE During on site visits 
OCE will affirmatively encourage recipients to use such
intermediaries and will not request direct access to or control
over client case files or any other records containing privileged
or confidential information 


 
Flexibility of Approaches OCE shall consider and seek to
accommodate reasonable approaches to access to records proposed by
recipients to protect privileged or confidential information so
long as such proposed approaches also ensure access by OCE to
information it needs to carry out its responsibilities Such
reasonable approaches may include unique client identifiers when
appropriate 


 
Unique State Ethics Rules LSC acknowledges that there
may be states where the rules of professional responsibility 
ethics rulings case law or other laws differ from the general
framework under the Model Rules of Professional Responsibility and
where the disclosures sought by OCE may implicate the recipient
attorneys professional responsibilities or other law Recipients
have the responsibility to bring such ethical rulings to the
attention of OCE as set forth in section below after they have
been notified by OCE of an impending request for access to records
containing privileged or confidential information


 
Questions of Attorney Client Privilege OCE shall not
have access to information protected by the attorney client
privilege including information covered by section h A
recipient shall notify OCE under the procedures set forth in
section below that the information sought is in the recipients
view protected by the attorney client privilege 


 
Procedures for Addressing Privileged or Confidential
Information If a recipient believes that documents or information
requested by OCE contain information that is protected by the
attorney client privilege applicable rules of professional
responsibility or other law the recipient will send written notice
to OCE as soon as possible setting forth a full description of
the nature of the privileged or confidential information a
statement explaining the basis for determining that such
information is privileged or confidential and any
recommendations of reasonable approaches to accessing such
information Upon receipt of this notice OCE will so notify the
Vice President for Administration and seek to find a mutually
satisfactory manner for obtaining access to the information
consistent with the applicable rules of attorney client privilege
and professional responsibility and consistent with LSCs need for
information to ensure compliance 


If OCE is not able to expediently resolve all outstanding issues
of concern it will through the Vice President for Administration 
promptly so advise LSCs President and the Vice Presidents for
Programs Legal Affairs and Government Relations of the access
issues raised and the specific reasons why the proposed alternative
methods of access are inadequate The Vice President for
Administration and Programs with advice of the Office of Legal
Affairs then will review the concerns raised by the recipient If
the Vice Presidents for Administration and Programs do not agree
with the position of the recipient then LSC will so notify the
recipient in writing and OCE will proceed with the review 
If Vice Presidents for Administration and Programs agree that
the recipient has a reasonable claim that the information is
privileged or confidential then OCE will further seek to develop a
mutually satisfactory manner for obtaining access to the
information consistent with the applicable rules of attorney client
privilege and professional responsibility and consistent with LSCs
need for information to ensure compliance 



 
Disputes Between LSC and Recipients If OCE and the
recipient cannot agree on an approach that will give OCE
appropriate access to the records it needs and is consistent with
the recipients responsibilities to protect privileged or
confidential information OCE through the Vice President for
Administration may recommend to the Vice President for Programs
that LSC should take appropriate action with respect to the
recipient The Vice President for Programs will review the
recommendation and make further inquiry as appropriate The Vice
President for Programs may request that and the President may
direct OCE to further work with the recipient on an acceptable
resolution or appropriately modify the request 

If the Vice President for Programs determines that LSC should
proceed to take action affecting the recipient it shall notify the
recipient in writing of the action that is proposed If the action
involves suspension or termination of funding LSC will proceed in
a manner consistent with Parts or of Title of the Code
of Federal Regulations However if the action involves a sanction
or adverse action other than termination or suspension then LSC
may and is encouraged to allow a recipient an opportunity to
further present its position Such a process could follow the
following procedure The recipient would be given an opportunity to
request a meeting with the Vice President for Programs to ask for
reconsideration of the proposed action If the recipient requests
such a face to face meeting the Vice President for Programs would
convene such a meeting and make a recommendation to LSCs President
as to how LSC should proceed As soon thereafter as is practical 
the Vice President for Programs would notify the recipient in
writing of the recommendation to the President and the reasons
therefore The recipient may then request a meeting with the LSC
President to ask for reconsideration of the Vice Presidents
recommendation The recipient would be given the opportunity to
provide such additional written information as it believes will
assist the President to fully and fairly consider its concerns and
objections Upon such request the President could also convene a
face to face meeting with the authorized representatives of the
recipient As soon thereafter as practical the LSC President would
advise the recipient of the final decision and reasons therefore 
The decision of the LSC President would be in writing and shall be
final and binding 


 
If LSC management determines that a recipient has taken
an unreasonable position or refused to work in good faith with OCE
on these issues then LSC may take reasonable corrective action in
addition to pursuing access to the information in
question 


 
In describing these procedures LSC does not in any way
waive the statutory rights and obligations of LSC or LSC recipients
regarding access to and review of LSC recipients records and
information These procedures do not create new rights or
obligations for LSC or LSC recipients and may be modified by the
LSC President as warranted with appropriate notice to the Board
and field programs 







 
 
 
 Red Pants



 While writers whose business it is to be witty
often fail to produce grave authors occasionally
are mirthful when laughter is farthest from their
minds From a lifetime of undisciplined reading with
innocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind 
I have gleaned a harvest of what I am pleased to denominate
Red Pants items a sampling of which follows 
My designation derives from a splash of vivid
writing in Francis Thompsons A Corymbus for Autumn
in which he proclaims how  days dying dragon
was


Panting red pants into the West 
 

 In this trousers category Thompson must share the
limelight with Coleridge by virtue of the line in Kubla
Khan 


As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing 
 

 Even Shelley may stake a claim if only in the pajama
division of this sector thanks to his description in
Epipsychidion of how


 the slow silent night
Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep 
 

 Since everthing is to be found in Shakespeare it is not
surprising that on at least two occasions the Board has
contributed his own Red Pants nuggets In Antony and
Cleopatra Act IV Scene VIII lines et seq Antony
commands the wounded Scarus to


 leap thou attire and all 
Through proof of harness to my heart and there
Ride on the pants triumphing 
 

 And in Othello Act II Scene I line Cassio utters
the fervent prayer that Othello might

 Make loves quick pants in Desdemonas arms 

 A variation on this theme occurs in Alba de Céspedes
The Secret translated from the Italian by Isabel
Quigly Simon and Schuster New York page
 where she confides that  I still had a whole afternoon
before me to spend and I used it to tidy up my
drawers  One may well wonder what Miss Stowe
had in mind when in Uncle Toms Cabin Chapter 
she narrates how  Mrs Shelby stood like one stricken 
Finally turning to her toilet she rested her face in her
hands and gave a sort of groan  In this same vein the
mirthless Milton adds his bit to the general hilarity of
nations when in describing Mount Etna in Book I of
Paradise Lost lines   he penned


And leave a singed bottom all involved
With stench and smoke 
 

 And in Chapter VI of Vanity Fair when Blenkinsop 
the housekeeper sought to console Amelia for Joe
Sedleys jilting of her dear Rebecca Thackeray confides
 indelicately  that Amelia wept confidentially on
the housekeepers shoulder  and relieved herself a good
deal 

 Chuckles often emanate from the British employment
of a term in a sense at variance with American
usage There is that oft quoted example near the
opening of Trial by Jury where Defendant asks  Is
this the Court of the Exchequer  and having been
assured that it was Defendant aside commands himself
to  Be firm be firm my pecker  The British of
course do not giggle at this bit of Gilbertian dialogue 
since to them pecker means `courage as in the phrase
 to keep your pecker up  Two of the more common
examples of British American divergence of usage are
screw and knock up In Vanity Fair Chapter the
niggardly Sir Pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat
your American sophomore might fancy him to be
when he  screwed his tenants by letter  He was simply
making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees 
Similarly when in Chapter XXXIV of the same
novel Mrs Bute reminds her husband that  Youd have
been screwed in goal Bute if I had not kept your
money  she was not speaking of pleasures deferred In
Bleak House Chapter XXVII Grandfather
Smallweed referring to Mr George warns Mr 
Tulkinghorn that  I have him periodically in a vice Ill
twist him sir Ill screw him sir  In Kiplings The
Light That Failed Chapter XIII Torpenhow urges
Dick to attend a party that night  We shall be half
screwed before the morning  is his dismal sales pitch
to Dick 

 In Chapter VI of Vanity Fair Thackeray reports
on Joe Sedleys drunken avowal to wed Becky Sharp the
next morning even if he had to  knock up the Archbishop
of Canterbury at Lambeth  in order to have
him in readiness to perform the ceremony In Great
Expectations Chapter VI we learn how   Mr 
Whopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad
temper  And who could blame him 

 Many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from
the pure minded use of a word that suggests unmentionable
parts of the human body It does not take a
too wicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a
lewd nature Who can for instance blame a youth
with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing
when he reads in Paters Marius The Epicurean Chapter
V a reference to Apuleius The Golden Ass noting
that  all through the book there is an unmistakably
real feeling for asses   In Scotts The Bride of
Lammermoor Chapter VII one reads about a boy
 cudgelling an ass  and one goes back over the passage
to reassure himself that it does not contain a typographical
error for  cuddling 

 One may be indulged a giggle even though he is
sure that Isak Dinesen did not intend an impropriety
when she recorded in Out of Africa Part V Chapter
 how  Fathimas big white cock came strutting up
before me  And one is certain that Kenneth Rexroth 
in his American Poetry in the Twentieth Century
 Herder and Herder N Y did not intend to hint
at closet biographical matter when in Chapter I he
wrote that  Whitmans poems are full of men doing
things together  or later in the same chapter when he
referred to  Whitmans joyous workmen swinging their
tools in the open air  College freshman still read with
flendish glee the first line in Canto I of Spensers The
Faerie Queene and never mind the title that tells
how

 A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine 

 In his poem Mr Nixon from Hugh Selwyn Mauberley 
Ezra Pounds Mr Nixon advises kindly

 don’t kick against the pricks 

 although the identities of the latter are not divulged 

 One is entitled to speculate on what outrageous
proposal the narrator had made in Prousts Remembrance
of Things Past Vol  Cities of the Plain
 translated by C K Scott Moncrieff Modern Library 
N Y Page to cause the Duchess to say 
 Apart from your balls cant I be of any use to you 
There is a famous letter penned by Rupert Brooke to
his friend Edward Marsh from somewhere near Fiji
 p of A Treasury of the Worlds Great Letters 
Simon and Schuster N Y in which he relates
how he sends his native boy up a palm tree where he
 cuts off a couple of vast nuts  macho victim not
disclosed In the first chapter of Uncle Toms Cabin 
Miss Stowe offers a dialogue between Haley and Mr 
Shelby part of which goes   `Well said Haley after
they had both silently picked their nuts for a season 
`what do you say   In Bleak House Chapter XXIV 
Dickens may cause some readers to blush when he
wrote of Mr Georges blush that  He reddened a little
through his brown 

 We must move ineluctably to a consideration of
perfectly reputable words which having acquired sexual
connotations cause adolescent and often adult 
hilarity even when read by a person of only mildly
prurient mind In Forsters A Passage to India Chapter
XXXI a vivid picture is created by the sentence
 Tangles like this still interrupted their intercourse 
Pages later Chapter XXXVII it is acknowledged that
 He too felt that this was their last free intercourse 
Apparently from then on it was going to have to be
cash or credit card only In The Bride of Lammermoor
 Chapter V we are informed that the heroine  placed
certain restrictions on their intercourse  a limitation
that might have been more usefully set in that same
authors Rob Roy Chapter VII where we are told of
the chance that the narrator and Miss Vernon might be
 thrown into very close and frequent intercourse 

 A variation of this theme is found in Robert
Brownings The Flight of the Duchess Section V 


 Not he For in Paris they told the elf
Our rough North land was the Land of Lays 
 

 even though it is generally acknowledged that Paris is
número uno in this area of human activity 

 More picturesque are the references to erections 
An arresting one occurs in A Passage to India Chapter
XXI in which Forster describes a small building as  a
flimsy and frivolous erection  while in The Mayor of
Casterbridge Chapter XVI the Mayor himself  beheld
the unattractive exterior of Farfraes erection  A
phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader 

 Consider Dickens sharp image in Bleak House Chapter
LIV when he describes how  Sir Leicester leans
back in his chair and breathlessly ejaculates 
Or in Nicholas Nickleby Chapter XLVII where that
admirable novelist graphically portrays how old Arthur
Gride  again raised his hands again chuckled 
and again ejaculated  And in his short tale Lionizing 
Edgar Allan Poe is quite candid in describing the reaction
of one of his characters   ` Admirable he ejaculated 
thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the
manoeuvre 

 Alas for perfectly lovely words that acquire pejorative
meanings over the years Earlier in this century 
pansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete
male thereby cheapening forever lines like Shelleys
noble image in Adonais verse XXXIII 


His head was bound with pansies over blown 
 

 not to mention Poes odd allusion in For Annie 


With rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies 
 

 Or more slap stickish E F Bensons action picture in
Lucia in London Chapter  Georgie stepped on a
beautiful pansy 

 Of more recent vintage is gay Nobody used to
snicker at Chaucers line No in The Prologe of
the Wyf of Bathe in which that harried dame asks 


Why is my neghebores wif so gay 
 

 In his poem The Menagerie one of William
Vaughan Moodys characters advises 


If nature made you so graceful don’t get gay 
 

 while in Othello ah the Bard again in his dialogue
with Desdemona and Emilia on the praise of women 
Iago refers to the kind that


Never lackd gold and yet went never gay 

 Act II Scene I line 
 

 And what in the world is one to make of William
Butler Yeatss startling revelation in his poem Lapis
Lazuli from Last Poems that


They know that Hamlet and Lear are gay  
 

 Indeed it is an amusing albeit utterly wasteful
pastime to pursue the quest for Red Pants examples 
May good cess befall all such quixotically misguided
readers One caveat never assume blithely that an odd
word or suspicious phrase is as lubricious as it sounds 
In The Bride of Lammermoor Chapter VI Bucklaw
vows  I will chop them off with my whinger  and one
feels quite let down when he learns that a whinger is
but a whinyard which is merely a short sword

 LIGHT REFRACTIONS




 If you are a fan of old fashioned jazz what is now
known as  traditional or  trad jazz you are familiar
with one of the standard  jump tunes of the
genre a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble 
Even if you are not a fan you must have heard it
as least a dozen times It is the one that goes  Dah 
Dah Dah Dah da dat dat dah Da de da de da de dat dat dah
 da de da de da de dat dat dah 


Thats it sure youve heard it 
 

 I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble
back in about when I was in my early teens 
My memory is rickety but I am sure my first recording
was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE and I think though I
am less sure that it was played by the late  Muggsy
Spanier who was to my mind one of the greatest of
jazz trumpeters Later I got another recording of the
same tune this one by I think Mezz Mezzrow The
label said MUSKAT RAMBLE I thought that was surely
the first time I had ever seen such an obvious typographical
error in of all things a simple title on a
simple  rpm record This remember was in my
youth and it was a time when typographical errors
were called typographical errors not typos at least
by kids in junior high Some time later I got still
another version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE with still another
version of the title This time it was MUSCAT RAMBLE 
That I thought was really absurd Not only had they
left out the  R theyd changed the  K to  C Now it
made no sense at all On the other hand I reasoned if
there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat 
perhaps it wasn’t so outrageous I looked up muscat in
my Websters and found that it is a `variety of grape 
To name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to
me preposterous I was young and by todays standards 
at least pathetically innocent 

 During my time in senior high and after that in
the Army Air Force I had other things on my mind
 there was a war on after all and I didn’t give
the MUSKRAT MUSKAT MUSCAT RAMBLE problem any
thought 

 Speaking of my time in the AAF which was utterly
undistinguished I think I must make a confession 
Now might be as good a time as any to reveal a
theft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour 
Indiana It was winter and bitterly cold The wind
used to sweep across that damned airfield with what
seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our
bodies One day when the wind chill factor was nearing
absolute zero I took shelter in the service club 
There was the omnipresent phonograph or Vic short
for Victrola and the stack of records next to it In
those days people as a rule did not take much care of
phonograph records Usually the records were taken
from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks where
they picked up dust scratched one another and
traded static electricity I was shuffling through a stack
of about fifty records and I came across three Bessie
Smiths I played all three and the few other G I s in
the room which was quite large big enough for a
fair sized dance with a small orchestra either paid
no attention or asked me to put on something by Glenn
Miller or Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead Among
Bessies numbers were Dying Gamblers Blues Sing
Sing Prison Blues and one I had never heard called
Black Mountain Blues which has the imcomparable
lines 


Home in Black Mountain a chile will smack yo
face 

Home in Black Mountain a chile will smack yo
face 

Babies cry for liquor an all the birds sing bass 
 

 and


Goin back to Black Mountain me an my razor
an my gun 

Goin back to Black Mountain me an my razor
an my gun 

Goin cut him if he stan still goin shoot him if he
run 
 

 I was and still am captivated by  Babies cry for
liquor an the birds sing bass  and in the arrogance of
my youth I was certain that nobody else on the airfield
either knew or cared who Bessie Smith was nor
would any other G I be enchanted by basso birds so I
turned thief I cant remember how I did it but somehow
I smuggled those records back to my barracks and
got them home intact on my next furlough I kept
them in good shape until my last  rpm turntable
died 

 End of digression and back to MUSKRAT KAT CAT 
Muskrat Ramble is credited to Edward  Kid Ory and
Ray Gilbert  Kid Ory played great jazz trombone 
The only thing I know about Gilbert is that I find him
listed as co author of Muskrat Ramble 

 About thirty years ago when I was concocting an
epicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand I
went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel
that was being sold for an absurdly low price and
that I thought might be exactly right for my sauce It
wasnt bad The wine jogged my thoughts back to
Muscat Ramble Muscatel is made from muscat
grapes is sometimes called muscat and being relatively
cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content is
the booze of choice for a great many wines An old
college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth
birthday meaning twenty years of AA sobriety a
couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the
skids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk
tank the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle
and Napa Valley smoke 

 I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble was
almost certainly the original name of the tune My
reasoning is that it is not likely that  Kid Ory or Ray
Gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even less
likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat
doing anything that we would be likely to think of as
rambling Muskrats according to my encyclopedia 
look like giant rats are found in and around the
mudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds have
partially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimming 
They do not appear to do much rambling Muscat 
or muscatel on the other hand is found on skid
rows all over the land A guy with a bottle shaped
brown paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper
end has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet
wine of high proof and the odds are pretty good you
would find it is a muscadoodle After the guy finishes
his Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off he is looking
for the means to get another muscat fix Now he is on a
ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his
roadmapped eyes I suspect that that is precisely the
songs origin 

 My theory is that the  r got put in there simply
because muskrat is a more common word than muscat 
It is the same reason most of us I assume have heard 
 Hes in the hospital with prostrate trouble  Prostrate
is a more common word that prostate so prostrate is
what we get The  r fits in naturally I got a strange
sort of corroboration from my good friend Rosy
McHargue who is now pushing eighty seven years and
has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with
some of the best jazzbands Benny Goodman Red
Nichols Ted Weems and a slew of others Rosy too 
had seen the tune as Muskrat Muskat and Muscat I
asked him what he thought the original title was He
had known  Kid Ory well and he said  You know 
Tom i’m not exactly sure I once asked Ory about it
and he said `Its m u s c a t Muskrat So I think thats
just the way everyone said muscat 

 There you are I find a muskrat ramble difficult to
imagine visually I picture muskrats wallowing about

 Leonard Bloomfield having begun with a theory
of meaning which emphasized the environment in
which objects were present and named had to add the
obvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is
not present I have lately been reading accounts of the
exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of
Australia in the s and I have become very aware of
the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency
of particular items in discourse In the desert
the missing necessity is water As the explorer Ernest
Giles put it the explorers experience is a  baptism
worse than that of fire the baptism of no water 

 My impression was that in the journals of desert
explorers the word water alone or in compounds and
words relating to water were unusually frequent It is 
I suppose likely that people with little money must
think of money more than the well off do and that the
hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty
on drink Here was a chance to quantify such things I
decided to make a count of words relating to water in
reports of desert exploration 

 Taking quite at random a single page page in
the journals of the Gregory brothers recording an early
 exploration of country east and north of Perth I
find the word water used fifteen times Ten pages on
 page water occurs nine times but there are also
the related words stream twice well twice pool 
channel and the circumlocution  essential element 
Two words dew and shower refer in the context to the
presence of water the rest are in contexts indicating its
absence 

 I tried another explorer Ernest Giles Taking
page again I was reminded that Giles is rather
given to semi serious poetic diction at times and we
find him referring to the presence of water in the Finke
River as  the stream purling over its stony floor or 
quoting some bygone poet  brightly the brook through
the green leaflets giddy with joyousness dances
along  Perhaps present water called for some stylistic
celebration Two hundred pages further on there is less
exuberance in the circumlocution  that fluid so terribly
scarce in the region  and in three other references
water is simply water Giles is not always waxing poetic
and may like other explorers be useful as a source
for the history of Australian and general English His
use of the word tank to refer to a hollowed out reservoir
  Gibson dug a small tank and the water soon
cleared antedates the OED for instance 

 Since this linguistic statistical study of an obsession
might well prove to be an important contribution
to psycholinguistics I decided to make a larger sample
of watery words choosing the straightforward journals
of Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton who led an expedition
across the western interior of Australia in
   In a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages
   of the published journal there were twenty eight
occurrences of the word water eight of them in
compounds no page being without at least one example 
In addition there was a rich collection of words
relating to water not necessarily indicating its presence 
 Hoping to find a lake is included though of
course it doesn’t indicate the presence of water Even
words which are usually of more general reference are
brought into relation with water in a text like this 
Gum trees or rocks in areas of sand appear as signs of
possible water Apart from these words and lake 
words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of
water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include
pool springs drainage hole clay hole flood channel 
water courses water hole rock hole drink drinkable 
running water stream and native well 

 The last two items merit comment Stream is often
said not to be used in Australia except in metaphorical
ways normally being replaced by creek 
Warburtons use  sandbanks intercept the stream 
which finally splits into narow water courses and
spreads itself over the plains and so it ends as a creek
suggests a somewhat more complex relation between
the two words British born explorers did not set out to
write Australian English of course Gregory uses
stream in the way normal in England Giles consistently
refers to gens in the hills of central Australia 
though glen is not current outside place names in
contemporary Australian English 

 The other name native well is as a later explorer
David Carnegie author of Spinifex and Sand 
points out a misnomer He believes native wells are
essentially rock holes depressions in rock buried in
fairly shallow sand which when hollowed out by the
natives appear to be wells This sort of misnomer
leads Carnegie to suppose that  to the uninitiated no
map is so misleading as that of West Australia where
lakes are salt bogs without surface water springs seldom
run and native `wells are merely tiny holes in the
rock yielding from to gallons 

 Carnegie also describes namma holes and soaks as
sources of water Soaks are shallow wells sunk near the
base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir 
Namma holes have been variously described to Carnegie
they are depressions on the surface of rocks often
with a rounded bottom where stones are often found 
suggesting that the stones have something to do with
the formation of the holes 

 Some nostalgic early Australians deplored the loss
in our speech of English country words the glens and
streams alive anyway in the journals of explorers 
coppices and brooks woods becks and rivulets Perhaps
these words did not really fit We might have
done better with Arabic speaking settlers Wadi for
instance would describe an inland creek rather well 
Be that as it may a later Australian visitor to English
drizzle might feel nostalgic when thinking of the
parched and thirsty but water obsessed vocabulary developed
in the drier areas of our sunburnt land 
 
 
 Favorite Grammatical Game Puzzling Pronouns




 Here is a game just made to while away the hours
on a commuter train with your favorite author 
a perfect place to hunt for Puzzling Pronouns 

 
 Fowler lists five instances where a careless writer
can go wrong There is really no excuse Fowler says
 not he says but here we give examples of his third
case only where  there should not be two parties justifying
even a momentary doubt about which the pronoun
represents  And here the deluge of printed matter
abounds with such specimens that one would
suppose them to be the rule rather than the exceptions 
It is a game that is like fishing in a barrel but more
stimulating mentally I am not picking on the following
authors it is just a random catch 

 In Thomas Hardys The Hand of Ethelberta it is
suggested by Ethelberta that she and some others go to
see Miltons tomb in Cripplegate church Her suitor 
Neigh who had proposed marriage in a previous
chapter appears somewhat apprehensive at Ethelbertas
suggestion This apprehension is observed by a
Mr Belmaine and mistaken by him for an indication
that Neigh has been dragged into going to the church
against his will  by his over hasty wife  One wonders
whether the marriage had secretly taken place between
the consecutive chapters You see it is
Belmaines wife who was doing the dragging 

 Somerset Maugham was a good and careful grammarian

 The Joys and Oys of Yiddish



 Rabbi Robert Schenkerman
 Temple Beth Jacob
 When Isaac Bashevis Singer was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature in he remarked
in his acceptance speech 


The high honor bestowed upon me is also a recognition
of the Yiddish language a language of exile 
without a land without frontiers not supported
by any government a language which
possesses no words for weapons ammunition military
exercises war tactics 

There is a quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude
for every day of life every crumb of success 
each encounter of love In a figurative way Yiddish
is the wise and humble language of us all the idiom
of a frightened and hopeful humanity 
 

 The word Yiddish derives from the German
judisch `Jewish The principal parent of Yiddish is
High German the form of German encountered by
Jewish settlers from northern France in the eleventh
century Yiddish is written in the characters of the
Hebrew alphabet and from right to left and enjoys
borrowing words from Russian Polish English and
all the other languages and countries along the routes
that Jews have traveled during the past thousand years 
Journalist Charles Rappaport once quipped  I speak
ten languages all of them Yiddish 

 Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out
for hundreds of years the language is spoken today by
millions of people throughout the world Russia Poland 
Rumania France England Israel Africa 
Latin America New Zealand Australia Canada and
the United States where like the bagel it was leavened
on both coasts in New York and Hollywood It is
spoken even in Transylvania A beautiful girl awakens
in bed to find a vampire at her side Quickly she holds
up a cross  Zie gernisht helfen  smiles the vampire 
Translation  It wont do you any good 

 Most of us already speak a fair amount of Yiddish
 Yinglish without fully realizing it Websters Third
New International Dictionary lists about Yiddish
words that have become part of our everyday conversations 
including 


cockamamy or cockamamie `mixed up ridiculous 

fin slang for `five dollar bill from finf the Yiddish
word for `five 

gun moll a double clipping of gonifs Molly Yiddish
for `thiefs girl 

kibitzer `one who comments often in the form of
unwanted advice during a game often cards 

mavin `expert 

mazuma `money 

mish mosh `mess 

schlep to `drag or haul 

schlock `shoddy cheaply produced merchandise 

schmeer the `entire deal the `whole package 

schnoz slang for `nose 

yenta `blabbermouth gossip woman of low
origins 
 

 and so on through the whole megillah `long 
involved story 

 A number of poignant Yiddish words defy genuine
translation into English 


chutzpa `nerve unmitigated gall a quality we
admire within ourselves but never in others In
his delightful study The Joys of Yiddish McGraw Hill
 Leo Rosten offers two classic
definitions  Chutzpa is that quality enshrined in
a man who having killed his mother and father 
throws himself on the mercy of the court because
he is an orphan A chutzpanik may be defined as
the man who shouts `Help Help while beating
you up 

mensch a `real authentic human being a person 
naches the `glow of pleasure plus pride that only
a child can give to its parents  This is my son 
the Doctor 

oy not so much a word as an entire vocabulary as
Rosten observes  can express any emotion from
trivial delight to the blackest woe 

oy vay oy vay in mir literally  Oh pain  but in
its long or short form can be used for anything
from condolence to lament 

On August the worlds first nuclear
weapon was dropped on Hiroshima Japan Two
hundred and eighty two thousand human beings
died and tens of thousands more were left
burned maimed and homeless Albert Einstein 
whose letter to Roosevelt had initiated the
American effort that resulted in the atom bomb
and whose special theory of relativity formed its
theoretical basis heard the news on the radio 
For a long time he could only find two Yiddish
words traditionally used by Jews in such circumstances 
 Oi vey 

 The Little Brown Book of Anecdotes

tsuris the gamut of painful emotions some real 
some imagined some self inflicted 
 

 Yiddish is especially versatile in describing those
poor souls who inhabit the world of the ineffectual 
and each is assigned a distinct place in the gallery of
pathetic types schmo schmendrik schnook schmegegge 
schlep schlub schmuck putz klutz kvetch 
and nudnik Yiddish easily coins new names for new
personalities a nudnik is a `pest a phudnik is a `nudnik
with a Ph D The rich nuances that suffuse this
roll call are seen in the timeless distinction between a
schlemiel `clumsy jerk and a schlimazel `habitual
loser the schlemiel inevitably trips and spills his hot
soup all over the schlimazel And the nebbish is the
one who has to clean it up 

 The Yiddish language through its color its target accurate
expressions its raw idioms and its sayings
exudes a refreshing magic and laughter mixed with
sober thought that has been handed down from generation
to generation and from nation to nation Yiddish
never apologizes for what it is the earthy wise
soul of an expressive people learning that life is but a
mingled yarn good and ill together 

 Which reminds us of the zaftig `buxom well rounded
blonde who wore an enormous diamond to a
charity ball  It happens to be the third most famous
diamond in the whole world  she boasted  The first is
the Hope diamond then comes the Kohinoor and then
comes this one which is called the Lipschitz 

  What a stone How lucky you are 

  Wait wait  said the lady  Nothing in life is all
mazel `good luck Unfortunately with this famous
Lipschitz diamond comes also the famous Lipschitz
curse 

 The other women gasped and asked  And what is
the famous Lipschitz curse 

  Lipschitz  sighed the lady 
 
 
 The Womens History of the Word
 Those who are not familiar with feminist writings
may find it useful and interesting to consider a book 
recently published in Britain that is typical of the
harsher brand of such works The work in question
offers nothing regarding language so its review here is
ancillary to the main function of VERBATIM The feminist
movement is very much alive in Britain and the
 Greenham Common Women are probably largely
responsible for much of the national sentiment against
the Cruise missiles installed at an American base near
that village In Britain as elsewhere most books by
feminist writers are reviewed by women usually feminists 
Men are seldom assigned to review them possibly
because the editor fears that they will be either
ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised if not
biased against them or because the editor is a woman 
Because writing an unfavorable review of a bad feminist
book would be tantamount to treachery such
books are often unjustifiably praised as was the case
with this work by Rosalind Miles which was well received
on its publication in June 

 According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this
distinctly unpleasant book Rosalind Miles is head of
the Centre for Womens Studies at Coventry Polytechnic 
a lecturer broadcaster journalist and author of
several other books including a  highly acclaimed
biography of Ben Jonson One might like to believe
that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship 
but the text does not bear out the promise 

 For the most part the book consists of a rewriting
of history from the dawn of time with the purpose of
demonstrating two main themes the  fact that
women were responsible for all the important contributions
to the advancement of civilization as the development
of agriculture for instance often despite
the arrogance and stupidity of men and the  fact
that women have long been subjected to domination
by men Miles suggests that such domination is a recent
phenomenon only a couple of thousand years
old for she points to the clear superiority of women
in primitive religions and matriarchies right on
through to the Egyptian dynastic rulers At one point 
she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests
that females were responsible not only for all of
human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of
counting in order to keep track of menstruation and 
probably by the same token astronomy She quotes
 and presumably accepts another source which holds
that  woman first awakened in humankind the capacity
to recognize abstracts  If you believe that balderdash 
youll believe anything 

 In the good old days we were taught that the
pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves 
Recent speculation has it that they were not slaves
but what would one call them    ordinary laborers 
Here comes Miles authoritatively quoting Diodorus 
the Greek historian who recorded   BC that  innocent
women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves
whose forced labour built the pyramids 


 bound in fetters they work continually
without being allowed any rest by night or day 
They have not a rag to cover their nakedness and
neither the weakness of age nor womens infirmities
are any plea to excuse them but they are driven by
blows until they drop dead  p 
 

 As the pyramids were already about years old
when Diodorus wrote his World History one is given
to wonder what his authority might have been for such
a vivid description It is even less comprehensible how
a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery
to promulgate it Miless book is riddled with
many similar distortions convenient omissions and
generalizations 


 Women have always commanded over half
the sum total of human intelligence and creativity 
From the poet Sappho who in the sixth century BC
was the first to use the lyric to write subjectively
and explore the range of female experience to the
Chinese polymath Pan Chao Ban Zhao who
flourished around AD as historian poet astronomer 
mathematician and educationalist the range
is startling In every field women too numerous to
list were involved in developing knowledge and
contributing to the welfare of their societies as they
did so the Roman Fabiola established a hospital
where she worked both as nurse and doctor becoming
the first known woman surgeon before she
died in AD p 
 

 Earlier on page we learnt about Agnodice  who
lived to become the worlds first known woman gynaecologist 
in the fourth century BC Clearly this rosily
checkered past was soon to be replaced chiefly it
seems as Judeo Christian Islamic Confucian Buddhist
cultures flourished It was not too bad early on 
when according to Miles the seven Maccabean martyrs
who  saved Judaism did so only at the instigation
of their mother Miles continues 


In early Christianity likewise women found not
merely a role but an instrument of resistance to
male domination in choosing to be a bride of
Christ they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male
fry Thousands of young women helped to build
the church of God with their body blood and
bones when frenzied fathers husbands or fiancés
preferred to see them die by fire sword or the
fangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout sic 
the duty and destiny of womanhood p 
 

 But the situation soon deteriorated 


Even St Paul later the unregenerate prophet of
female inferiority was forced to acknowledge the
help he received from Lydia the seller of purple
dyes in Philippi ibid 
 

 This rewriting of history is punctuated by an array
of four letter invectives applied to males and by
adjectives like brilliant unusual inspiring and so
forth to women Citing a Judaic law book of the th
century which identified a woman for the days preceding 
during and following her period as niddah
`impure Miles has the lack of taste to write the following 


As a final stroke in a grim foreshadowing of
what the future held in store for the Jews the niddah
had to wear special clothing as a badge of her
separate and despised status p 
 

 Here and there in this morass of misunderstanding 
Miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with
the eminent anthropologist Joseph Campbell Campbell 
known for his extensive analyses of the worlds
mythologies religions and cultures noted the marked
bias against women emerging from Judaic concepts 
later reinforced by Christian and Islamic doctrine 
Most of the religions of the world connected woman
with mother earth fertility and all the other
progenetic and nurturing associations and this was
borne out in the cultures of the people According to
Campbell the only godlike female figure in the Bible
is the Virgin Mary and she appears identified as virgin 
only in the Gospel according to Luke As Luke was
a Greek Campbell suggested that Mary was a carryover
from the paganism of the ancient Greek pantheon 
Although this might help explain the Judeo Christian Muslim
tendencies to subjugate women 
treating them essentially as chattel it does not account
for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures 
notably that of Japan It is not entirely clear
whether Campbell was commenting on Hinduism 
Buddhism etc as they once existed conceptually for
it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment
of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering
to those religous precepts 

 Campbell held that the ancient mythologies and
religions are allegorical and that there was no real
distinction between gods and goddesses who were
given sexual identity when in human form only to
make them more meaningful With all respect that
seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex
for this discussion though we can certainly trace a
diminution in the role of female divinities or divinity 
when we come to examine Judaism and its congeners
and progeny Other debatable aspects are the questions
of whether the debasement of women is a reflection of
the theology or the ritual whether the scripture of any
religion should be understood allegorically or literally 
and so forth If there is something wrong it behooves
us to get at the roots of the problem not to flail about
wildly for only after the source of a disease has been
identified can one properly investigate its cure 

  History according to Rosalind Miles blasts away
at the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating
them will effect a cure of the disease In this
jeremiad males are viewed as the  enemy  and are so
characterized throughout the book which concludes
with exhortations to engage the foe and a strident call
to arms though not mens

 A VERBATIM Book Club Selection 

 Just when you thought it was safe to assume that
we now know all we are ever likely to know about the
past someone digs another hole and unearths literally
or figuratively some ancient artifact one day it is a
fragile scroll found in a cave near the Dead Sea that
turns out to be pre Biblical the next day it is an entire
terracotta army of Chinese soldiers the next it is a
skull excavated from the Olduvai Gorge that compels
anthropologists once again to revise their guesses
about the earliest stages of Homo sapiens sapiens vs
hominids Most of the relies from the past are gone
forever destroyed by the plows of countless generations
of farmers reduced to rubble by erosion by conquerors 
by prehistoric and modern urban developers by
fire and flood and just by time Many we may hope 
have not yet been found The interest in mans forebears
did not become fashionable upon the publication 
a few years ago of Roots on a far larger scale 
we have been trying to discover all we can about the
origins not of men but of man Strange to say however 
that interest does not seem to be more than a few
hundred years old if the ancient Greeks and Romans 
the Indians the Chinese and other peoples were curious
about their own prehistory I have not heard of it 
Perhaps the fascination with mans past grew out of
the obsession with ruins evinced by Romanticism certainly 
modern archaeology seems to have followed
close behind for the excavation of the supposed site of
Troy took place only about years ago Perhaps it is
just as well for only by the means available to modern
science are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts
that we find and through radiocarbon dating 
determine their approximate age 

 Archaeology is a popular pursuit and its manifest
results not only receive considerable publicity but can
be seen in museums Not so paleolinguistics or the
reconstruction of ancient languages Even the remnants
we have from early languages that had a writing
system are relatively sparse Classical Latin and
Greek Hebrew and a few other languages are better
documented than others but for most all we have to go
on are a handful of tablets here a few inscriptions
there barely enough in many cases to allow us to
identify the language let alone draw any conclusions
regarding its structure or meaning Perhaps one day
we shall find an Etruscan library buried deep in the
Italian countryside but for the present we have to
make do with what we have which is precious little 
About languages that had no writing system we know
nothing at all But some very clever comparative linguists 
beginning in Germany in the th century theorized
about how the nature of the ancestors of the
more modern tongues In some instances ancient languages
have been decoded some from multilingual
inscriptions The work of Jean Francois Champollion
   in deciphering hieroglyphics from the Rosetta
Stone was an astonishing accomplishment for it
enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient
Egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and
revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we
have today about their civilization which lasted for
about years Another significant break through
was that of Michael Ventris   who deciphered
the Linear B script found on Crete and identified
it as an early form of Greek From the standpoint
of language Ventriss work was more important particularly
because it filled in a gap in our knowledge of
the early states of Indo European languages 

 Many years ago a linguistic scholar counted all of
the languages then spoken of which he had evidence 
The total was approximately but that is probably
only a vague estimate he undoubtedly missed
some some have sprung up since his time modern
Hebrew for instance and some have vanished The
exact count is unimportant and at best spurious for
it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for
what distinguishes dialect from language Then too 
one must examine the techniques used to group the
many languages of the world 

 Linguists examining Classical Greek Latin German 
English Slavic Swedish Norwegian Danish 
Dutch Lithuanian Iranian Hindi and the other languages
of India and Europe found that there were
correspondences among many of the common words 
Some like French Spanish Italian and Portuguese 
had more in common with one another than they did
with say German English Swedish Danish and
Dutch which in turn bore only a remote resemblance
to Russian and Polish on the one hand and the
two extant varieties of say Gaelic on the other One
rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers
and toes for after years of laboriously categorizing
these languages the number of different main
branches called families and subfamilies came to
about ten Ingeniously certain differences between
families were explained by various phonetic shifts that
 inexplicably took place in one language group but
not in another Although certain other languages were
geographically nearby it was impossible to establish
any resemblances between them hence Basque for
example is not classified as being in the same family
with other European languages nor are Hungarian
and Finnish both of which belong to their own group 
At the conclusion of this vast exercise done without
the aid of computers there emerged a pattern of familial
relationships that linked together languages spoken 
in earlier times from Britain as far east as Chinese
Turkestan and from India as far north as
Lappland Charts showing the chief languages and
their derivations can be found in many dictionaries inside
the front cover of The Random House Unabridged 
for example Because linguists are constantly
learning more and more about the relationships
among languages it is best to avoid using an older
chart for the same reason it would be wise not to
stake too much on the accuracy of even a current
chart 

 The languages discussed here are what are usually
called the Indo European family similar family trees
could be drawn for the Semitic languages Sino Tibetan 
Japanese Bantu Malayo Polynesian and so on 
Each is a distinct phylum although there may be
word borrowing among them lexicon is considered
less important in the classification of languages than
structure and grammar It is important too to note
that writing systems are irrelevant for instance Polish
is written today using the Roman alphabet but Russian 
a related Slavic language uses the Cyrillic Yiddish 
a Germanic language is written in Hebrew characters 
Latin Greek and Sanskrit which resemble
one another rather closely in some respects all use
different alphabets and early examples utterly unrecognizable
to untrained readers of modern languages 
were written in cuneiform quite suitable for writing
on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus and hieroglyphics 

 
It would be nice to think that while linguists were
working so hard to organize languages they were
working alongside the archaeologists who were providing
the raw materials But only rarely did they collaborate
and with few exceptions their work was not
correlated in a systematic way Schliemann who discovered
the site of Troy used the evidence in Homers
Iliad to determine his digging site where any ruins
had long since disappeared from view In many other
places the ancient sites lay buried and still
do beneath modern cities modern property owners
quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down
their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of
an ancient town will be found several yards below 
today before a new building is erected in London an
archaeological team examines the cleared site for its
archaeological significance But there as everywhere
else nothing can interfere with progress and regardless
of the finds and their importance the archaeologist
must eventually yield to the bulldozer Notwithstanding 
even the brief glimpses afforded by such
investigations can provide some insight into civilizations
that existed hundreds or in some cases thousands
of years earlier 

 Based on the sparse evidence available linguists
theorized about the earlier languages that had given
rise to those attested In other words based on what
they knew about a group of languages which were
documented they tried to imagine the language that
they sprang from In most cases they dealt with words
and functional elements creating what are called reconstructions
in hypothetical family prototypes called 
variously Proto Latin Proto Greek Proto Germanic 
Proto Indo Iranian and so forth the ultimate goal
being to posit a single language called Proto Indo European 
That is not entirely true for linguists know
too much about language to suggest that there ever
was literally a single language from which all Indo European
languages descended Nonetheless it is convenient
to think about the existence of a group of
proto dialects which can be referred to as Proto Indo European 

 
It seems only natural that once an original language 
or Ursprache was posited the next step was to
speculate on its source or Urheimat That is what
Renfrew has tried to do Essentially he proposes that
the parent of all Indo European languages was itself
born in central Anatolia whence it spread eastward 
westward and northward being modified by the influences
of the languages with which it came into contact 
till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable 
modern manifestations which we categorize into Germanic 
Hellenic Italic Indo Iranian Anatolian Armenian 
Celtic Tocharian Albanian and BaltoSlavic 

 I have no quarrel with Renfrews theory notwithstanding
the generally received wisdom that has
placed the homeland north of the Black Sea region
and the Volga steppes It is difficult for the nonspecialist
reader like me to assess the validity of his arguments 
which are based on his contention that the
language and its congeners were carried along by the
spread of nomad pastoralism Using the evidence available 
Renfrew contends that the original Indo European
language closely related to Hittite separated
after BC with the IE languages of western Europe
developing from western Anatolia and those of
Iran India and Pakistan from the eastern division 
The choice between the prevailing theory and Renfrews
depends on whether one accepts a  wave theory 
first promulgated more than a hundred years ago
by Johnanes Schmidt a German linguist or one of
indigenous development Pottery finds can be interpreted
to support either the imposition of an elite culture
from Turkmenia or a late development of the
Indus civilization Renfrew accepts the wave theory 
and in the last two thirds of Archaeology Language
he sets forth his arguments in its favor Unfortunately 
the presentation of his linguistic argument where the
author is clearly treading on more speculative ground
than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology 
where he is on more familiar territory is disorganized
and repetitious It is difficult to place all the blame on
Renfrew for his editor should have noticed the lack of
coherence The result is an argument that is persuasive
but scarely convincing 

 Nevertheless good books on archaeology assimilable
by laymen are not easy to find and if the reader
can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned
about the precise birthplace of Indo European 
Archaelogy Language provides an interesting march
through the millennia of prehistory in seven league

 Websters Electronic Thesaurus
 This software consists of two disks one labeled
Installation and Program the other Synonym Linguibase 
and a manual The manual sets forth everything
with clarity and the program is simple to install requiring
only a few minutes Only one thing made me a
little suspicious when cranking up the system in the
descriptive text that appears on the screen the word
labeled is spelt  labelled decidedly un American 
However I went ahead and since I was typing the
text you are reading returned to the beginning of the
paragraph to see how some of these words would fare 
I looked up the word preceding and was after a brief
moment asked to type in the word which I did The
screen bloomed forth with the following 

 Query preceding

 adj being before especially in time or arrangement

 There were also some other parts of speech one
definition for the preposition and three for the verb
 participial senses I called up the synonyms for the
adj and the following appeared 

 Synonyms 


antecedent anterior foregoing former past precedent 
previous prior
 

 The way the program works is this one uses the cursor
to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are
desired It is similar in principle to finding a synonym
in a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonyms
to find them I am not sure why but I expected
the program to  network in the same way However 
when I highlighted antecedent what appeared on the
screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent
missing and preceding had reappeared If all this
is too complicated to follow let me summarize you
look up word X and get synonyms A B C D E F 
and G You look up the synonyms for word A and you
get synonyms X B C D E F and G Even the
definition provided for the sub listings is identical in
wording to that of the word originally sought 

 This is very economical of space and involves a
clever computer ploy but it does not provide a particularly
useful synonym dictionary for as we all know 
synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative
law of mathematics in language  Things equal to
the same thing are not necessarily equal to each
other  Perhaps the Proximity people thought that they
had got round that little problem by giving the same
definition for each of the items in the list but we know
that only very rarely are two synonyms bi unique
 which is another way of saying that if A   B B does
not necessarily always equal A an ineluctable fact of
language 

 If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary
is likely to be of use then this package may be of
service It works with a hard disk or with a set of
floppies and can be used with popular word processing
programs That was the number listed when I
received my copy it might have increased It also has
a few neat features like suggesting a few alternatives if
you happen to think that preceding is spelt  preceeding
 as many people do It has a useful  Help feature
that can be called upon at any stage Also if you
enter jump you get the synonyms for that but if you
enter jumped you get the same synonyms but inflected including
the variants leapt leaped for leap 
All in all for a relatively primitive system it is not too
bad but you would have to be in love with your computer
to use it in preference to a far more complete
books of synonyms available especially The Synonym
Finder Rodale in the U S and Canada Longman
elsewhere which offers more than synonyms 
more than three times the number listed in any other
synonym book 

 The blurb on this book disk package reads  Supplies
you with true synonyms for entries 
My guess is that such a quantity might be
reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations 
in reality though there are probably far
fewer actual words Readers can judge for themselves
the validity of this numerical legerdemain

 Family Words
 In American Speech published  Family
Words in English  by Allen Walker Read which was
reprinted in VERBATIM Vol I No The article
is a classic probably the first on the subject to appear
in a scholarly journal though there are other informal
references to family language some of which are documented
by Dickson in his Bibliography 

 Family words and expressions crop up everywhere 
Some are quite unique and their reporters cannot
imagine their origin others like Penn Station 
 what one family terms a childs misinterpretation of a
famous line or phrase  are clear the generic term
comes from the Lords Prayer  And lead us not into
Penn Station  Obviously that works only for kids familiar
with New York City Other Penn Stations 


Our Father which art in heaven Harold be Thy
name 

Land where the Pilgrims pried 

Bells on cocktails ring 

I pledge my allowance to the flag 

Gladly the cross eyed bear
Onward Christian Soldiers 
Marching as to War 
With the cross eyed Jesus 
Leaning on the phone 

 One nation invisible 

 One nation in a vegetable 
 

 Many people know F H B for `family hold back an
exhortation ensuring ample provender for guests 

 This is not to suggest that Dicksons book is a
catalogue of bloopers or what Amsel Greene and
Jack Smith like to call pullet surprises There are
many interesting entries in Family Words which as far
as I know is the first documentation of the genre 
There are occasional hidden entries as the list of diseases among
them the dread mohogus  under the
entry for Fowlenzia In the VERBATIM family some
suffer from Fowlers pip an affliction affecting language
fanatics who base a slavish purism on a literal
interpretation of Modern English Usage 

 
 Family Words is useful and fun Inevitably some
of the entries are more imaginative than others Dickson
will have his hands full if everyone responds giving
private words Please sent yours to the author c o Addison Wesley

 A Midwesterner Will Hays Jr who is proud of
his knowledge of post Civil War history tells me the
following origin of shot as in shotglass absent from
 Gunning for the English Language 

 Although we associate trench warfare with World
War I trenches were characteristic also of the Civil
War A scaffold was built so that a rifleman 
who fired a single shot muzzle loading shoulder
weapon could step up and shoot over the top of the
trench The soldier in charge would command after
each firing that the rank on the scaffold step down
and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded 
thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire 

 That war like others produced disgruntled veterans
and those more adventurous or more restless after
military service They moved westward to start a new
life The population increased markedly with corresponding
demands for goods and services among them
the need for saloons Most new saloons were small and
the bars short accommodating with difficulty the
many bunched up in ranks if you will calling for
whiskey Many of the thirsty crowd were veterans as
were many of the bartenders Thus  Step down or
back and give me a shot was readily understood Ive
not been able to corroborate this explanation but Ill
never forget it 




 
 

 Mr Joseph Hymes  Do Mistake Learn Better
 XV brought to mind the time a Japanese acquaintance
told me of a friend of hers who decided to tackle
the original English version of three books she had
enjoyed while in Japan She boldly marched into a
bookstore and asked the salesclerk for a copy each of
Hemingways The Sun Come Up Again and Throw
Away the Gun and Steinbecks The Angry Grape Is
there a term for the errors that creep in while translating
a passage back into the original tongue 




 
 

 Mr Davidsons observations on the Scottishness of
Chambers th Century Dictionary XV bear out
my own formed over sixteen years of using one An odd
sidelight on this came a few days after reading the
article Definitions under pet end with  Petting Party

organised sport Origin unknown not from Gaelic  I
think it hardly fanciful to discern a note of Calvinist
disapproval in this curt disclaimer 




 
 

 Although I greatly enjoyed Richard Lederers article 
I fear that one of his paragraphs is a load of brass
monkey balls 

 The monkey on board ship was a lad employed to
fetch supplies powder and so forth to the guns The
word might also have been used for a receptacle near
the guns where powder and balls were kept However 
this receptacle would have taken the form of a wooden
box or something similar The idea of a metal stand
carrying a pyramid of cannon balls so delicately balanced
as to be affected by the tiny differential expansion
of brass and iron does not bear thinking about in a
heavy sea 

 So what is the explanation of the phrase cold
enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey   Well 
the obvious one I believe Anybody who asks  Why a
brass monkey  is probably not aware that brass monkeys
were very common household ornaments in England
in the th and early th centuries Originally 
they were probably imported from India but were
later mass produced in places such as Birmingham to
grace Victorian and Edwardian mantelshelves They
can still be found today in so called  gift shops  Usually 
they come in sets of three one with its hands over
its eyes one over its ears and one over its mouth they
were said to represent  See no evil Hear no evil Speak
no evil  There were various whimsical variants 




 
 

 I am sure I am not the first to point out Joseph
Hyness  Do Mistake Learn Better  XV mistakes
in Japanizing English words e g sei fu not  safe o 
nain not  nine o  The possibilities for representing
English with a language of only forty seven syllables
are not that numerous and the rules are very consistent 
The main problems are representing consonant
clusters and word final consonants These difficulties
produce such monstrosities as sutoraike for English
`strike one syllable in English five in Japanese 

 Every Japan veteran has his list of favorite mistakes 
Mine are the ones that are possible but wrong

Gone with the Windo Hypercorrection where Japanese
speakers learn that many final vowels do not exist
in the American version of the tongue and so remove
them sometimes incorrectly gives us the California
cities of San Francisk and Sacrament This process
resulted in the sign reading Pizz and Coffee 

 My absolute favorite of these semantic mistakes 
however does not come from the problem of sound 
Japanese has a verb inflection which expresses causation
or permission in English  to make someone or
to let someone do something  One day during a university

 You Could Look It Up
 As everyone in the world must know by now William
Safire writes a column in The New York Times
Magazine called  On Language  Considering the circulation
of The New York Times on Sundays his column
is probably the most widely read commentary on
contemporary English in the world that places more
than one uncommon burden on a writer he must do
his utmost to be accurate he must try to select subjects
likely to be of interest to his readers and he must
write well 

 Those familiar with Safires editorial style reflected
in his political columns on the editorial pages
of The N Y Times may agree with me in the contention
that when he writes about language he seems to
be writing on his day off I cannot put my finger on
why but  On Language always strikes me as an excruciating
effort to be cute In part that is attributable
to the designation of his correspondents who
keep him informed on language that is not within
earshot as the  Lexicographic Irregulars  an amusing
reference the first time or two it was used but now
beginning to cloy More often than it might prove of
interest to me personally Safire deals with insiders
language in Washington where he is based or with
trivialities uttered by some politico 

 As Andrew Norman wrote in a letter published in
this book on page  You flit freely back and forth
between prescriptivism and descriptivism  But are not
many of us guilty of that  We are descriptive of the
usages we accept and prescriptive perhaps proscriptive
would be more descriptive of those we do not
like At least Safire expresses an opinion whether the
reader agrees with him is another matter as are the
questions of his accuracy which arise fairly often and
that of the suitability of his style which as far as I
know has not been broached before It ill behooves
me excoriated recently as enamored of the  cheap
larf  to criticize Safires arch puns which permeate  enliven
is probably the word his editor would
use his articles but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable
for reading however they might evoke a
chuckle when uttered viva voce A handful of examples 
from the book at hand 


Therefore I stand uncorrected p 

  Get your hand off my knee  that’s a mnemonic 
pronounced knee MONIC 

Ize Right  title p 

Juggernaughty but Nice title p 

 slanguist p 

Lex Appeal title p 

Logue Rolling title p 

 on  logue vs  log Some people prefer their
logues sawed off p 

But the Library of Congress wants to be non U in
its spelling of  logue words ibid 
 

 Writing containing such labored figures makes for
hard reading I am interested in what Safire has to say
about language but find myself stymied I get the feeling
that he has deliberately created a minefield of
interruptions in thought through which I must pick
my way to the end Notwithstanding the valuable role
he plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language
and in informing them about myriad facets of
the subject I find it hard slogging or as he would
probably write  sloguing 

 
 You Could Look It Up is the umpteenth collection
of Safires columns and like the previous collections 
contains a selection of letters from readers It is those
that are so sorely missed in his column True there is
an occasional mention in his column of a point raised
by a correspondent and the Letters section of the
Magazine prints a comment from time to time but an
important feature of the books is their inclusion of far
more writer reader interaction than one might suspect
from reading the column alone For one thing the
letter writers call attention to errors or misinterpretations
and are largely critical Safire cannot be accused
of being copy proud except evidently of awful puns 
as in   Ms is deliberately msterious but at least it is
not deliberately msleading  and other mscegenations 

 There is no gainsaying that Safire is one of the
most influential writers on contemporary English and
it is essential that his books be in the libraries of all
who are interested in the subject regardless of their
alignment with his opinions For one thing he documents
many neologisms an activity that endears him
to many working lexicographers From the sometimes
cavalier manner in which he treats his subject one
wonders if Safire feels the burden of the responsibility
he has toward his readers 

 The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from
which this review was prepared unfortunately there
was no proof of an index but the publisher has assured
me that there will be one in the published book a
rather essential ingredient of a work with this title

 Websters New World Guide to Current American
Usage

 Here is a commonsense style book useful to those
who have the education and common sense to be in
doubt about questions of English usage It has some
problems if you want to be sticky about things on p 
xv we read 


 Einsteins Special Theory of Relativity does
not say that E   MC² and in leap year MC³ 
 

 Indeed it does not But it does say E   mc² the version
with the capital M and C is essentially meaningless
to those familiar with the conventional symbolism used
in physics 

 While I acknowledge that it is not easy to know
how to sort out the many topics to be covered in a
usage book most reasonable writers have taken a stab
at writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely
place to look then have provided a detailed index Not
Bernice Randall True one can find different from 
etc in an entry so headed but for absolute constructions
one is referred to an entry called  Covered with
onions relish and ketchup I ate a hotdog at the ball park 
If the user wants to find out about misplaced
adjectives and adverbs reference is made to the entry
 Electric shaver for women with delicate floral design
on the handle  A search for only would be futile 

 Perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need
some lightening up but I am hard put to agree that
they are quite as frivolous and light headed as this
book would have us believe Fun is fun but those who
might rely on such a book are quite serious about the
information they are seeking and it is unfair to play
fast and loose with their sincerity A sense of humor
about a subject is born of a feeling of security about it 
but security is the one characteristic often lacking
among those who would use Current American Usage 

 There is no doubt that Randall enjoys her work 
But of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms  And of
what use are the interminable examples for instance 
of the misuse of like for as which draw out the entry
to three pages  More than four pages are devoted to
clichés under the guise of  Lo and behold its mans
best friend  which being an exclamation really
ought to end in an exclamation point The article on
British American English  Theres no home like Eaton
Place  is a good one but at six pages its utility is
questionable In the matter of pronunciations of
BrEng names it is an old fashioned fantasy of Americans
that Brits go round saying POM frit for Pontefract 
most Brits that I have heard give the name a
spelling pronunciation these days and so with many of
the old shibboleths Of what relevance to usage notwithstanding
the fact that the topic is interesting is an
entry on eponyms  John Bull and John Hancock are
not just any johns    That is not strictly speaking a
subject pertinent to the title of the book 

 All of which is to say that the book is an interesting
work on the language and contains accurate 
though longwinded information about what it covers 
 interesting and useful facts about American English 
Its only real faults are its title which belies the content 
the cutesy headings and the lack of a truly detailed
index self indexing does not provide coverage of
sufficient detail As a reference work on usage it is far
from complete The Simon and Schuster Publicity Department
could have used an entry on foreword 
forward spelt  foreward in the release accompanying
the review copy 

 A longish section  Some Troublesome Idiomatic
Prepositions  and a  Glossary of Grammatical and
Linguistic Terms Used in This Book  followed by a list
of  References  sources associated with specific entries

 Loose Cannons Red Herrings

 Readers should be familiar with Robert Claibornes
earlier books especially Our Marvelous Native
Tongue The Life and Times of the English Language 
One might say that subtitling the present book  A
Book of Lost Metaphors is an example of a loose
canon sic   unless metaphor is taken in its broadest
sense but one is unlikely to find red herrings here the
etymologies of a few hundred words and phrases are
given many not readily findable in standard works of
reference The rationale behind referring to them as
 lost arises from the authors observation of an unfortunate
state of affairs because of an increasingly widespread
lack of familiarity with the basic structural
elements of our culture Greek and Roman mythology 
the Bible literature and ordinary historical
fact people today are unable to discern the origins of
terms like aphrodisiac Achilles sic heel or tendon 
meet ones Waterloo sow dragons teeth and hand writing
on the wall to name a few There are many of
course but unaccountably they are not the focus of
this book 

 Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions
like sow ones wild oats about which he tells us little
or nothing the modern Latinate designation Avena
fatua came too many centuries after the original expression
to have any relevance to it so why bring up
the information that fatua is Latin for `foolish it was
also Latin for `wild which might be more to the
point In any event it is hard to discern from the arch
style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting 
just what is the origin of sow ones wild oats In
many entries Claiborne labors the obvious offering
little or nothing we do not already know could easily
imagine or for which the author offers no explanation 
Among examples of the first are spit and polish 
on the spot on the square stick ones neck out etc 
Examples of the last include spill the beans square the
circle stalemate etc Between these is an occasional
flash of useful wisdom much of it pretty well covered
by other books of this type which seem to be proliferating 

 What is missing for example at square the circle 
is the information that because the area of a circle is
mathematically calculated using pi which is irrational 
there is no mathematical way of calculating the
dimensions of a square with the same area as that of a
given circle But that does not mean that such a square
cannot exist As for stalemate which is related to
checkmate would it not have been important to indicate
that the   mate part has nothing to do with English 
having been borrowed from checkmate which is a
loanword from Persian and has nothing to do with
check either 

 Often an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology
and merely explains the meaning Does any
reader need an entry like this one 

 
 straddle When you straddle a horse youve got
one leg on either side of the animal When a
politican straddles an issue he’s in much the same
position 

 Some speculative suggestions as the derivation or
reinforcement from Seidlitz powders for take a powder
are sheer nonsense Not all entries contain misleading 
dull or incorrect information but those that do
not are marked by a lack of originality

 Word Maps

 Dialect geography a branch of dialectology describes
certain features of the dialects of a language
and their distribution The field is about years old 
Most prominent among its earliest practitioners in
England was Joseph Wright who prepared the six volume
English Dialect Dictionary which was published
between and the best known contemporary
British specialist is Harold Orton In America 
work proceeded space during the s largely under
the direction of Raven McDavid Hans Kurath and 
later Harold Allen more recently Lee Pedersen and
others have investigated American English dialects 
Between and fieldworkers based at the University
of Leeds conducted the Survey of English Dialects 
which studied localities in England which 
as everyone ought to know does not include Wales or
Scotland The present book is extracted from the two
major works that resulted from the Survey The Linguistic
Atlas of England and A Word Geography
of England both under the direction of Harold
Orton aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the latter
effort 

 People generally seem to find dialect study interesting 
One letter writer to The Times June 
reported 


Our close neighbour in Bere Regis who was
born in the village and who speaks with a delicious
Dorset burr always uses  I instead of  me  

 Well it makes company for I and company for
she  Another of his happy expressions is inner wards 
meaning `since as in  I chucked him
out the door and he’s not been back innerwards 
 

 Another reported same date 


Lets get it right The Bristol for  me is not  I 
but  oi  When I was teaching there the explanation
invariably given by boys brought to me for
scrapping in the playground was  Ee it oi so oi
it ee 
 

 The maps selected for representation from the
Survey yield information on several hundred words 
some of which are clear variants others quite different
lexical entities For instance Map shows the areas 
marked off by boundary lines where the variants
chimley chimbley chimmock chimdey chimbey and
chimney occur Map shows the distribution of child
 most of southern England and of bairn north of a
slightly wavy line between Boston on the Wash to the
east and Lancaster on the west coast 

 The authors have provided a brief introduction
which is easy to follow a list of suggested readings 
and the names and addresses of the several institutions
and societies in Britain where readers may indulge a
more intensive interest in dialect study The maps are
clear each occupying a full page and the word information
is well set forth on them Where necessary 
brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any
information that might seem to be out of the ordinary 
I have only one nit to pick with the authors In their
description of isoglosses they write 


These are drawn to run midway between 
localities which were shown by the Survey of
English Dialects to use the different words or
pronunciations which are the subject of the map 
 

 Although it is true that isoglosses in effect set off the
various areas where a particular usage was recorded 
more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites
either where speakers employ both usages or where
speakers using one or the other live in very close proximity 
Hence the term isogloss from iso   `same   gloss
`word to describe the line on a map where the terms
are of equal distribution Isoglosses are to dialect maps
what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps what
isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans etc 
The authors are not alone in getting this wrong it is
incorrect in some dictionaries 

 In those countries where dialect study is undertaken 
dialectologists observe that there are today
many factors militating against the strict maintenance
of older dialect boundaries the standardization of terminology
as adopted by national periodicals news
services radio and television the establishment of
 prestige dialects and through the media their
promulgation and the huge population shifts that
have taken place particularly in the U S since WWII 
Such shifts have been somewhat slower in England 
but seem now to be speeding up There are many
other lesser factors at work but taken together all
tend toward standardization especially as the older
speakers die off In some respects it may not be long
before certain aspects of dialect geography will be
largely historical The importance of dialect is emphasized
regularly in the press where we read about people
being killed as in parts of India because they use
the wrong shibboleths 

 This book is a good introduction to the subject in
England those familiar with dialectology in
America and those interested in the study in England
or indeed generally would be well advised to add

 American Literary Almanac

 This is an interesting useful reference book containing
information about the better known writers of
America It is divided into eighteen chapters varying
in length each dealing with a different aspect of the
authors and their works among them 


Writers Related to Writers
Schooldays which colleges and universities
spawned which writers 
American Literary Pseudonyms
American Literary Title Sources
Literary Cons Hoaxes Frauds and Plagiarism
in American Literature
The Profession of Authorship 

Authors Publishers  Editors Agents
Thrown to the Wolves Reviews and Reviewers
 

 These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography
and a detailed Index 

 As can be seen from the chapter headings some of
the material is trivial but nonetheless interesting for
that It is not at once apparent why the book is styled
an  almanac  but that is unimportant there is no
other book I know of that contains as much diverse
information about American writers as this one Its
readability and organization make it suitable for
browsing even for reading straight through so in
that respect at least it does not resemble books in the
 Oxford Companion series It contains many photographs
of writers some quite early these enliven the
appearance of the book but accomplish little else unless
one is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked
like at the age of as a printers devil or in the
appearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle of a
railroad track in Cleveland in 

 It is difficult to make any sensible connection between
the lives of authors and their creations A handful
might have led colorful existences some are objects
of interest because they died early committed suicide 
were related to other famous people and so forth 
but such information seldom reveals as much about
their output as do the creations themselves and in
certain cases one is probably better off not knowing
quite so much 

 This book appears to have been diligently researched
and has much to recommend it as an adjunct
to most libraries public and private large and small 
general and specialized

 Fetal Viability

  Viability  has become the
focus of the abortion debate Last week the Senate rejected Majority Leader
Tom Daschles bill banning the abortion of  viable fetuses   But William
Bennett and William Safire hailed Daschles bill as the great compromise that
might settle a quarter century of arguments about abortion Forty one states
already restrict the abortion of viable fetuses What is a viable fetus  How is
the concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues of
abortion 

 
 Roe
vs Wade the case legalizing abortion made fetal viability an
important legal concept The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot put
the interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the
fetus is  viable   The court defined viable to mean capable of prolonged life
outside the mothers womb It said this included fetuses that doctors expected
to be sustained by respirators The court accepted the conventional medical
wisdom that a fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of a
pregnancy the third trimester sometime between the th and
 th week a pregnancy usually lasts weeks Because the point of
viability varies the court ruled it could only be determined case by case and
by the womans own doctor Even if the fetus is viable the court said states
could not outlaw an abortion if the womans life or health was at stake 

 Justice Sandra Day OConnor argued in a decision that
Roe was on a  collision course with itself   She said that
improvements in technology would continually push the point of fetal
viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy allowing states greater
opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion And this seems to be the
case  up to a point Doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the
 rd week  a week earlier than was thought years ago Most
hospitals will only perform abortions through the nd week of
pregnancy 

 But no
baby has ever been successfully delivered before the middle of the
 nd week Babies delivered during the nd and
 rd weeks weigh just over a pound Their lungs have barely
formed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale Circulation
depends on the use of ventilators and injections of hormones A baby born
during the nd week has a percent chance of survival And
about half of these survivors are brain damaged either by lack of oxygen from
poor initial respiration or too much oxygen from the ventilator 
Neonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the
 nd week because before then the lungs are not fully formed 

 
Probability of survival increases for babies
born later in pregnancy percent in the rd week percent in
the th week percent in th week By the
 th week when a newborn doesn’t require a ventilator to breathe 
it has a percent chance of survival And only after the th week
do the risks of long term brain damage begin to substantially subside Because
premature babies depend on technology survival rates vary based on access
to that technology For instance in rural communities which commonly lack
expensive infant intensive care units survival rates in these early weeks are
much lower 

 Doctors
assess a fetuss viability by attempting to guess whether its lungs have
formed Sonograms allow doctors to estimate the fetuss weight which
correlates with the lungs development and to look for signs  such as the
development of functioning eyelids and creases in the skin  that
coincide with the onset of a functioning respiratory system None of the
methods for predicting viability are very precise 

 Despite important Supreme Court decisions since 
modifying the doctrine of Roe the courts thinking about fetal
viability has remained fairly constant The only significant revision
came in the Casey decision which made viability even more
important The court said that state laws could require a woman and her doctor
to perform tests to prove that a fetus is not viable before she obtains an
abortion 

 Forty one
states now have laws restricting post viability abortions Some allow doctors
to decide for themselves if the fetus is viable Some require doctors to
perform tests to prove a fetus is pre viable and require multiple doctors to
certify the findings Eleven states have banned the procedure called intact
dilation and extraction IDE   also known as partial birth abortion   in
the belief that this procedure is used mainly post viability 

 
Banning IDEs nationwide is a major goal of the
pro life movement Movement adherents claim that the IDE procedure  in which
delivery is induced the fetuss skull is crushed and its brains are
suctioned  amounts to infanticide Barring this procedure is also the only
regulation of abortion that public opinion polls say has a majority of
support Pro choicers say the ban on IDEs is inconsistent with Roe 
because the procedure can be used to abort pre viable fetuses 

 Some medical ethicists
and constitutional scholars say that the Supreme Court was wrong to create
the pre viability post viability distinction in the first place Why they ask 
does the fact that a fetus can survive outside the womb with the help of vast
medical technology change either of the interests at war in the abortion
debate the fetuss own claim to  human ness  and a womans right to control
her body  Even if viability is an important moral line is it drawn in the
right place  Keeping alive a baby born in the nd week costs
several hundred thousand dollars and usually fails regardless of the
effort 

 The fuss over post viability
abortions ultimately concerns only a very small number of procedures 
Less than one percent of all abortions performed take place after the
 st week In only abortions were performed after the
 th week 

 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 Selling Land to Jews

 Last week a  year old
Palestinian real estate dealer was murdered after he violated a new edict by
the Palestinian Authority making the sale of Arab owned land to Jews a capital
crime The issue of land sales has a long history as a subtheme of the
Jewish Arab struggle 

 The
 th century Jewish intellectuals who conceived of
Zionism   the idea that Jewish survival depends on the establishment of a
Jewish state in the biblical land of Israel  never worked out their ideologys
logistics Jewish settlement in Palestine then part of the decaying Ottoman
Empire only proceeded piecemeal In the s and s about Jews
immigrated to Palestine Most integrated into multiethnic communities in the
cities of Jaffa Tiberias and Jerusalem A second wave of immigrants
came between and many of whom were Labor Zionists who wanted the
Jewish state to be socialist Extolling the virtues of manual labor they
acquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee Syrian and Lebanese landlords 
The  New Palestinian Jew   they said needed to be physically tougher
than the brainy shopkeepers who had been trampled in Europe 

 The Jewish National Fund was founded in for the
purpose of buying up land from Arabs After the Ottoman Empires defeat
in World War I Britain acquired Palestine and promised in the Balfour
Declaration the creation of a Jewish state In anticipation Jews in Palestine
began laying the groundwork for a greater sense of national identity The
Jewish National Funds charter was amended to mandate that Jewish land could
never be resold to Arabs or opened to non Jewish employees 

 Following
Jewish National Fund guidelines farmers evicted Palestinian peasants living on
the newly acquired plots The total number displaced was small By Jews
owned only percent of Palestine but the perceived threat of displacement was
widespread among Arabs Starting around Arab newspapers railed against
Jewish land acquisition Among the peasantry rumors spread alleging an
Anglo Jewish conspiracy to remove Muslims from Palestine Anxious to avoid
being blamed for Palestinian landlessness British officials began imposing
token restrictions on Jewish land purchase in They publicly supported
Arab complaints that Jews were driving Arabs off the land 

 
Palestinians say evictions destroyed
their way of life forcing them to move from rural Palestine to crowded cities
in search of work They also say that the better educated Jewish buyers had
duped illiterate peasants into selling property 

 The Arab
National Fund created in by wealthy Arab families to purchase land for
displaced peasants was ineffective During the s Palestinian responses
turned violent In Jerusalems mufti the spiritual leader of the
citys Muslims decreed that believers were duty bound to murder other Muslims
who sold land to Jews Arabs who outnumbered Jews by more than  to  
revolted against Jewish land acquisition and British promises of Jewish
nationhood About Arabs and several hundred Jews were killed in riots and
guerrilla attacks between and 

 Zionists argued that the land purchases benefited all the
territorys residents Jewish immigrants introduced modern agricultural
technology which increased productivity and helped fill the markets with
food to feed the growing Arab population Zionists also maintain that Jews
became a lucrative market for Arab manufactured goods 

 Some
historians trace Palestinian landlessness to Palestines entry into the
world economy in the s Urban commerce drew some peasants from their
family farms Other subsistence farmers found themselves competing with
cash crop entrepreneurs Jews and Arabs whose successes changed the face of
Palestinian agriculture Jewish land purchases were not the primary factor 
these historians say 

 
Very little of the land owned today by
individual Jews and the Israeli government was acquired by purchase Jewish
sovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are by
war Israel confiscated all land owned by the British government mostly desert
and mountains after the War of Independence Property owned by
Arab refugees who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by the
Israeli army another long standing controversy was also taken over by
individual Jews or confiscated by the government Many Palestinians however 
stayed put retained their land and became Israeli citizens 

 A new
school of Jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by
Jewish land acquisition and concludes that it was not always fair One popular
theory compares Zionisms imperative to acquire land to the American idea of
Manifest Destiny that it was the United States God given right to rule
from coast to coast Others argue that it was a mistake for the Jewish
National Fund to prohibit non Jewish laborers from the newly purchased lands 
However even these revisionists agree that the Jews had not intended to evict
Muslims from Palestine 

 Israeli security officials believed that the murdered
real estate dealer was executed by plainclothes Palestinian Authority
police The Palestinian Authoritys decision to make the sale of land to Jews a
capital crime reflects Palestinian frustration with Israeli land use 
specifically the creation of a new Jewish neighborhood now under
construction in East Jerusalem 

 In the past death
threats have done little to deter sales of land According to British land
records the Jerusalem muftis decree failed to prevent sales But that
decree did not have the power of civil law behind it Nevertheless the
incentives to sell at the market price are substantial and if the threats
create new scarcities higher prices will probably encourage sellers to unload
their land 

 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna
 

 Dear Joe 

 I know what you mean about being a journalist Almost every assignment is a
challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier I often feel as
if I only get half the story sometimes so I typically do a massive amount of
reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need I think that is
why I welcomed doing a book  it gives one the ability to use so much of what is
left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism 

 Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we
never add to stories Most often reporters recount these tales with each other
and with their sources rather than share them with the general public Much of
it of course using the standards of top newspapers cannot be used since it
is largely gossip we are repeating although it certainly could make for some
very good stories I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be
written about this era probably decades and decades hence as it is too close 
In any case there certainly is no lack of information available about the
moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons I would
posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the
current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur 

 So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to
watch The smart boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully I
personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just
one man  at AOL for example there was a conscious effort to develop other
 characters   for lack of a better word So there while you think of Case you
also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives 
Steve Ballmer of course is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft but
it still seems to be Bills show over there 

 While I did not attend the trial  I was lucky to be able to read your highly
amusing and informative dispatches several of which made me spit up my lunch
laughing  it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and
the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good that’s ironic since I
think it was just that insularity that helped them much in the same way that
AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon
Valley AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here I am sure 
since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati Out
in the D C area they looked positively exciting next to all the
government oriented contractors I wonder if that means geography is destiny 
and its still location location location 

 From where I am sitting I think the Microsoft trial has been the really
obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age I think it
almost does not matter what the judge does since its clear that the balance of
power is shifting again although it not clear where it will land Will the
strongman of the era be AOL AT T Microsoft or one of the big media
companies  Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and
encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of
businesses where none are allowed to dominate 

 I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company  whether
it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney  is in charge of all our destinies Babylon
was That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem
possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empires grip on
humanity But we all know how that story turned out 

 Now I am getting way too philosophical but this is my final missive so why
not  Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going As for
me Ill stick with my philosophy of reporting and I guess life  nobody
knows

 USA
Today leads with Texas settlement of its product liability lawsuit
against the leading tobacco companies The top nonlocal story at the Washington Post is the latest development in the Indonesian
economic crisis  a rare and boosterish Suharto press conference in contrast to
a further plunging stock market and food riots in outlying towns The New York Times
leads with a comprehensive poll about American attitudes concerning
abortion 

 In the Texas case reports USAT the defendant companies have agreed
to pay about billion over years to reimburse the state for expenses it
incurred in the treatment of smoking related illnesses That makes Texas the
third state to settle such a case joining Florida and Mississippi There are 
says the paper a total of such suits on file with Minnesotas turn coming
next week 

 The Wall Street Journal states that the plaintiffs lawyers
hired by Texas to try the case will receive as part of the deal almost 
billion in fees 

 The NYT abortion survey the first conducted by the paper since was
based on telephone interviews of people and detects  a notable shift from
general acceptance  of having the procedure from percent to percent And
the pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortion
timing Sixty one percent of those polled thought abortions should be permitted
during the first trimester but only percent in the second and just 
percent in the third The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why a
focus on partial birth abortions has proven politically advantageous for
abortion foes Nearly percent of those asked to state the present law on
abortion could not give the correct answer 

 The WSJ notes that the just concluded football TV deal will probably
mean even steeper cable bills in the near future Some local cable
companies the paper says expect the fees theyll pay ESPN to go up more than
 percent And theyre in the habit of passing expenses along to Joe Remote 
Even nonsports fans will be affected notes the Journal because ESPN is
usually part of basic cable service Which raises the question Hasnt
technology progressed to a point that would allow cafeteria style programming
choices by subscribers  

 A scan of the headlines found cheek by jowl on the WP s Page A 
provides an interesting snapshot of the life of the modern Cabinet officer 
  Ex HUD Secretary Cisneross Ex Mistress Pleads Guilty     Labor Secretary 
Herman Denies Allegations of Influence Selling Scheme   and  Two Tyson Foods
Executive Indicted Over Gifts to Ex Agriculture Secretary Espy  

 The WSJ reports that according to an MIT survey Americans are twice
as likely to back a tax increase going toward the search for extraterrestrials
than one for gene cloning research 

 The NYT reports that todays issue of the journal Science will
describe an experiment in which peoples biological clocks were reset three
hours by shining a bright light on the back of their knees The finding if it
holds up says the Times may lead to a simple way for airline travelers
to fight jet lag 

 Yesterdays Los Angeles Times ran a story under the headline  Paula
Jones Works on Her Court Appearance   which illustrated by pictures of Jones 
was all about the various looks she’s had since stepping on the public stage 
The piece concluded that she’s finally graduated to an image thats
 sophisticated yet soft   Todays WP  Style  section that’s the
opposite of substance remember picks up that ball and runs with it with a
lengthy discourse on the new PJ  It is   hyperventilates
the Post one of the most jaw dropping public make overs ever   Jones
apparently has  smoothed the frizzy mane of curls that once reached to such
dazzling heights Her makeup is now subtle and based on natural not neon 
hues Her clothing is inspired by the boardroom instead of the secretarial
pool She has embraced the markers of dignity refinement and power   In true
newspaper overkill fashion the piece backs this up by consulting Cynde Watson 
national makeup artist for Bobbi Brown Essentials and Steven Zdatny a
historian at West Virginia University specializing in the aesthetics and
politics of hair 

 The placement of these two pieces is a PR triumph but one carrying the
seeds of its own destruction If people know all this work is going into making
Paula Jones seem a certain someone doesn’t that just make it obvious that
shes really somebody else 

 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 No More Kisses

 In light of Secretary of State Albrights imminent trip to the middle east 
the New York Times 
Los
Angeles Times and Washington Post emphasize the deteriorating situation
there But USA Today stays with Princess Di 

 The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday she will  read
the riot act  to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism Her goal will
be to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel 
telling him that there can be no more attempts at co opting Hamas and  no more
kisses  of its leaders 

 The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context Given that the
troubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat and
Israel but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Saudi
Arabia the paper states that the U S is now facing the prospect that the
moderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq and
Iran is falling apart 

 The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about
whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon 
dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was
ambushed with twelve deaths the result Perhaps the most striking indicator of
a change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that
cabinet member Ariel Sharon who as Defense Minister in got Israel
entrenched in Lebanon in the first place is among those urging a
reconsideration of the deployment 

 Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of its
controlling stake of Compuserve but its the Post with the news that
AOL is set to take it over 

 The Wall Street Journal  Outlook  observes  In the U S job
market the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers   and
states that  the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of
corporate downsizing   which left behind survivors who took stock of career
options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land
better offers which in turn led to counter offers and higher salaries This
has led says the Journal to annual compensation rising   percent a
year 

 Much of the continuing Diana coverage is spinning off into the realm of
meta  and meta meta pieces The LAT for instance examines what it
takes to be a new  cuddly feely  Britain born of the national grief experience 
But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as
well Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwill
ambassador job shortly before her death and USAT reports that Le
Figaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her family
and children 

 Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page
and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story  Not
everyone in Calcutta or India for that matter is unanimous in praising the
nun whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but
made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this
collapsing citys poor neighborhoods Salvation  hers and that of the destitute
she rescued from the gutters  was her aim not economic or social development
as many others understand it she said   Its odd however that in repeating
this charge the Times didn’t interview the man most closely associated
with it Christopher Hitchens or refer to the book where he set it out The
Missionary Position Hmmm wanna bet there was a copy of the book on
somebodys desk at the Times though 

 Whats with the top of the front headline the LAT puts over its
picture of Martina Hingis standing next to Venus Williams after beating her at
the U S Open   Venus Brought Back to Earth   doesn’t that sound like
celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory  How odd  and a good
illustration of how trying to shoe horn in a  witty  headline can drive you
into an idea that doesn’t fit or is undeserved Given that Ms Williams
parents are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a still
pretty lilly white sport don’t be surprised if theres a bit of a complaint
about this 

 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 Husbands and Wives

 Chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext
 and hence much of the appeal of a Hillary Clinton Rudy Giuliani Senate race
would be Wronged Wife vs Neglectful Husband By running against Giuliani who
has been reported in Vanity Fair to have a mistress  he denies it  and 
by all accounts has a sham marriage the first lady could exact symbolic
revenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the
Democratic party at the same time that’s almost enough for Chatterbox
to jump on the Hillary for Senate bandwagon 

 The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clintons
marital problems a major campaign issue  Giuliani makes Ken Starr look like a
patsy   cried Time this week But er would’nt  that be kind of a risky
strategy given his own problematic union  Many have already opined that the
mayor is too vituperative too much of a loner to practice the congenial 
teamwork oriented politics of the Senate other doubters have pointed to his
hardhearted uncaring social policies The last thing he needs is to draw more
attention to these qualities in his personal life 

 Giulianis estrangement from his wife Donna Hanover is made clear in an
interview with Hanover that appears in todays New York Times Hanover  would not say
whether Giuliani would run for the Senate whether she would like him to run
for Senate or whether she would campaign for him if he did But she did say in
the interview which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation
about Hillary Rodham Clintons interest in the same New York Senate seat that
Mrs Clinton is a very interesting person I think she’s dynamic and I
think she’s very smart and she’s an amazing speaker Ms Hanover said   And 
for a punch line  Ms Hanovers press secretary Joannie Danielides said this
week that Ms Hanover had no comment on Mrs Clintons potential Senate
campaign   Does she have any comment on whether Ms Hanover plans to be Hillary
Clintons campaign manager 

 
 Indis Index 
 Update NBC in its Juanita Broaddrick broadcast
last night turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by
Broaddrick in the late s that Bill Clinton raped her This
diminishes   slightly   the significance of Norma Kelseys possible
motives in verifying parts of Broaddricks story One of the three is Kelseys
sister whose motives can be similarly questioned the other two heard
Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip as only Kelsey and
Broaddricks husband claim to have However Chatterbox notes that NBC like
every other responsible news organization that’s covered this story reported
that Norma Kelseys fathers killer was pardoned by Gov Bill Clinton and
remains perplexed that the Journal editorial page wont Its Indis
Index is today up to seven 
 

 
   Timothy Noah and Jodi Kantor
 

 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 Even More  Proving Rape 

 Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial pages
coverage of Juanita Broaddricks rape charges against Bill Clinton see
 Proving
Rape    More Proving
Rape   as well as Michael Kinsleys
 Readme column in the current issue cries out for the introduction of the
Scientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press
responsibility With that in mind Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the
Intellectual Dishonesty henceforth to be known as the Indis 
Index here’s how it works Publications that refuse to acknowledge
 even if to refute the importance of highly significant but inconvenient facts
in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one
point for the initial offense They will then score one point for
every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense
is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient
fact  and an additional two points on days when the news organization
runs a follow up without making note of said inconvenient fact 
Publications receiving a score of will be inducted into the Indis Hall of
Fame Publications that get all the way up to will be faxed a likeness
of Joseph Stalin Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase
 intellectual dishonesty   because its pompous and falsely suggests that only
intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest But Chatterbox doesn’t know any
other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of
offense 

 For the purposes of this survey the Wall Street Journal will be
counted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal s
editorial page because in essence it is 

 The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma
Kelsey the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people
partially corroborating Broaddricks rape accusation is the daughter of a man
whose murderer was pardoned by Gov Bill Clinton A responsible account of the
whole controversy in todays New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon
had nothing to do with her corroboration The Journal editorial page
gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op Ed by
Dorothy Rabinowitz on Feb Because it has published three times since the
initial omission it scores an additional three points And because it
published an editorial Feb taunting the rest of the press for not following
it on the story  and still didn’t mention the pardon  it scores an extra
two points That comes to a total of six Chatterbox feels
certain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow up
tomorrow to tonights NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview which
means that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it
will be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest 

 Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus
points for having  eventually convinced  Broaddrick to grant an interview to
the New York Times as the Times reports in todays story But
the Scientific Method does not permit any tinkering with the Indis
Index s scoring procedures And besides Rabinowitzs efforts on the
Times behalf werent really unethical just puzzling given the two
newspapers intense rivalry When Chatterbox asked the Journal s DC
bureau chief Alan Murray who exercised good judgment in not breaking
the Broaddrick story and  full disclosure   is Chatterboxs former boss to
comment about a Journal employees feeding sources to the Times 
he replied  I don’t really have any comment on what the edit page did They do
their thing we do ours   Which is what Journal news employees are
instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing
embarrassment 

 For her part Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf
of the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them
sound  Ms Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared
 at the house in the a m and that she had refused an interview   Rabinowitz
writes in an e mail message  I asked her why she had decided to talk to the
New York Post s Steve Dunleavy and refused a Times reporter She
said Dunleavy caught her by surprise She asked if I thought it would be all
right to talk to the Times reporter I told her it would be  certainly
as all right as talking to Dunleavy She said Well i’m sorry I didn’t She
said she would if he called again I passed this on to Times reporter 
Felicity Barringer during our second days interview chat So  that’s how it
happens that in the New York Times piece today Im
described  solemnly  as having eventually convinced her to repeat the story
to the New York Times

 Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime

 There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This
Week this morning furrow browed and  heartbroken with all the evidence
coming out  against the president Last week when the Lewinsky story was only
a few hours old Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to
demonstrate his concern  These are probably the most serious allegations yet
leveled against the president Theres no question that if theyre true they
 could lead to impeachment proceedings  

 Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even
disgusting about Stephanopoulos eager show of independence from the president 
The problem isn’t so much his disloyalty Political figures turn on each other
from time to time for good and bad reasons were used to it Stephanopoulos
wants to run for the Senate and doesn’t want to seem a Clinton stooge By
lending credence to the Lewinsky charges and treating Clintons familiar
defenses as the lies and half lies they seem to be Stephanopoulos shows hes
not a fool 

 The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in
the first place During the campaign when Gennifer Flowers first brought
Clintons philandering to public attention Stephanopoulos  as Clintons chief
spinner distracter and all around bullshit artist  played a crucial role in
discrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth namely
that Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem don’t say Stephanopoulos didnt
know Again he’s not a fool Simply put Stephanopoulos did as much as any
man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments 

 The documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on
tape Early in the film with the Flowers crisis in full bloom Sam Donaldson
interviews Stephanopoulos who blames it all on the  Republican attack
machine    Gov Clinton has no character problem   Stephanopoulos declares 
Donaldson suggests that on Minutes Clinton had admitted to 
infidelity  He said he had problems in his marriage   says Stephanopoulos 
correcting Donaldsons deviation from the pre scripted fudge phrase of the day 
 Today of course the presidents defenders claim that Clinton admitted
infidelity on Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply
didnt care 

 Near the end of The War Room Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone
who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours which he is about to
publicize Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping
quiet  You would be laughed at   he tells the caller  I guarantee you that
if you do this youll never work in Democratic politics again Nobody will
believe you and people will think you’re scum  

 You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander protection
techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to
not get caught He was one of Clintons principal enablers to use a word
employed by Maureen Dowd in todays New York Times When Democrats
wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton they don’t need to look much
further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos Carville and
a cooperative campaign press corps helped to put over in 

 Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst 
Its as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid  s to soberly rue the
damage wreaked by Sen Joe McCarthy without any apology for his own role Much
has been made of the way famous wrongdoers e g Dick Morris Marv Albert 
rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture But usually at least a nanosecond
of contrition is required Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going
through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the
country If Clinton as is now increasingly clear was a time bomb waiting to
explode then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and 
muffled the ticking

 Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know 
 To help you see how much your contribution means i’m sharing with you
 The words of people who have lived Goodwills mission We want you to
 Know why your support of Goodwill is so important 
 Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and
 Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that
 comes with work 
  I was sad when I couldnt go to the snack bar to buy a soda Now I
 can buy a soda and spend money I like working and making money I have a
 savings account I can write my name on the deposit slip If I wasnt
 working here I would be sad      Maureen
 Because turning welfare recipients into tax payers just makes
 sense 
  When I first came to Goodwill I was a single parent with little or no
 self esteem I was on welfare and without my diploma Coming to Goodwill
 was the first step toward my becoming totally independent I am now
 totally off of welfare I really like my job      Sherry
 Because people want to work 
  Id never finished high school I had no experience or skills The
 only thing I did know for sure was here’s a chance to change things for
 me and my children I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow I
 wanted to be there I had my second chance to change my life     
 Donna
 Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire
 life 
  Before I got to Goodwill I was on a mission I just wanted a job It
 didn’t matter what the job was I just wanted one Now i’m on a journey 
 i’ve got more than a job i’ve got a career My instructor played a role
 like no other instructor i’ve ever had I appreciate everything that
 Goodwill has done for me      Cornell
 Each year we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles 
 Their one common goal they all want to work A robust economy helps by
 providing job opportunities but to be honest most of the people who
 arent working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest
 obstacles 
 The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like
 health care transportation and child care  problems that are big enough
 on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental
 disabilities illiteracy and lack of job skills 
 Last year Goodwill helped people find jobs that increased their
 self sufficiency Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support
 services that will help even more find jobs 
 Right now there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels
 like to support themselves You can help them to know that feeling 
 Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs Use the enclosed card
 and give a generous gift to Goodwill today 
 Sincerely 
 James M McClelland President
 
 


 
 
 
 Dear 
 A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success
 stories of people who got jobs with Goodwills help 
 here’s another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely
 source Goodwills controller Juli She tells me that the people
 we helped find jobs in earned approximately million dollars In
 addition to that by helping them find jobs Goodwill reduced the states
 Public Support tab by an estimated million Your gift to Goodwill will
 help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly
 support our work 
 What kind of work does Goodwill do 
 Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities 
 After Maureens job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant 
 we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with
 physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in
 the middle of society Remember what she said in my last letter   If I
 wasn’t working here I would be sad  
 Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance Sherry learned
 through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the
 welfare system and support her family At Goodwill she gained in
 self confidence in her vision of her future and in the job skills she
 needed to find and keep a good job  Coming to Goodwill was the first
 step toward my becoming totally independent I am now totally off of
 welfare  
 Goodwill prepares people for life long employment Cornell found a
 number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a
 work site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry He trained in
 desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with
 new found skills in a burgeoning industry  Ive got more than a job 
 i’ve got a career  
 Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill After a lifetime of trials Donna
 not only earned her GED at Goodwill she earned a job here  I rode a
 bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow I wanted to be there I had my
 second chance to change my life  
 Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their
 own stories of success Your support will help them go to work 
 Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill
 today 
 Sincerely 
 William A Carter Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation
 P S Your gift is a wise investment in the community For every dollar
 donated to Goodwill in we helped our  graduates  earn an estimated
 That money was then spent in a variety of ways adding fuel to our
 thriving economy

 Dear Personal Donor 
 In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job Robert has
 learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about minutes His job
 objectives call for him to do it in 
 He has no time to waste 
 Neither do we With the help of friends like you Goodwill has
 continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing
 society 
 We don’t waste time as we are helping the community And we dont
 waste money The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to
 continue our mission of helping people prepare for find and keep
 jobs 
 In their December review of the nations best charities U S 
 News World Report called Goodwill one of the five  Standout Good
 Guys   The magazine stated that Goodwill as well as the other standouts 
 is  uniquely effective innovative or valuable  
 While I appreciate U S News World Reports endorsement the
 true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on
 problems that affect all of us 
 Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment
 barrier the positive effects radiate throughout our community The
 business community welcomes not only another worker but a consumer with
 increased purchasing power Parents act as role models of
 self sufficiency instead of dependency Tax dollars that would have been
 spent on public assistance are saved 
 You and I know that solutions to difficult problems don’t just happen 
 At Goodwill it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our
 services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day 
 A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients  You
 can earn the money to support yourself and your family   she says  You
 can get off welfare I know you can I did  
 A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview
 to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing
 training program once his tears have subsided he confirms what his
 classmates have already figured out he just received a job offer    his
 first in five years 
 Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center a Goodwill staff member
 tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs On his
 way home he shares the story with four people at a street corner At the
 next corner he tells five more 
 In order to develop job skills a man with some serious disabilities
 begins working in Goodwills industrial division It takes a long time
 for him to gain the self confidence to work elsewhere in the community 
 Eventually he turns your support into a payoff for all of us He proudly
 leaves Goodwill to support himself 
 These people and their successes are real Just like the respect weve
 earned from U S News World Report Just like the impact Goodwills
 work has on our community 
 Real work Real results A real difference in peoples lives    in all
 of our lives 
 The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no
 time to waste Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of
 their success Your support helps provide real solutions 
 Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously
 to Goodwill today 
 Sincerely

 Dear Mailhouse donor reminder 
 You and I have done some important work together 
 Weve helped people break free of the welfare cycle Weve found ways
 for people with disabilities to enter the workforce Weve expanded
 Goodwills proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are
 needed most 
 Of course weve played different roles You have helped make
 Goodwills work possible with your previous support Goodwill has devised
 the programs that turned your investment into results 
 Who has benefited from our partnership  Everyone has When you and I
 help somebody find a job one more person joins the ranks of tax payers 
 fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain
 another consumer 
 There are a lot of barriers that keep people from working physical
 and mental disabilities history of welfare dependency and lack of
 education or self esteem And there are a lot of people who face these
 challenges every day of their lives So our work must continue 
 Everyone benefits from the work we do together Many people need our
 help 
 Please continue our important partnership Support Goodwill with a
 generous donation today

 Dear 
 Think of your greatest accomplishments Think of the joy and success
 they bring to you and your loved ones 
 Michael Sims felt that way at age    the day he earned a job 
 Michael was born with cerebral palsy Upon entering the work force he
 discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities 
 For several years he performed packaging and clerical work His most
 recent job lasted only a year before cut backs eliminated his
 position 
 For long months Michael could not find a job He resorted to public
 assistance dollars to survive Finally Michael called Goodwill 
 At Goodwill Michaels counselors felt that his personable demeanor
 could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job match
 where his people skills could shine 
 After three interviews Michael proved that he was the right person
 for the job As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments he now
 provides customer service for to tenants each night 
 At last he has found success in a job that he loves Now his goals
 are set on moving up in the company 
 Every year thousands of people come to Goodwill Like Michael they
 share two common characteristics They face some barrier to employment
 and they want to work 
 With support from people like you they can overcome their barriers
 and earn success and the self sufficiency that comes with it And then
 the pay off begins for the entire community 
 Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public
 support and more paying taxes Last year participants in Goodwill
 programs earned   and paid taxes on    wages of nearly million 
 Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three quarters of
 a million dollars in public assistance 
 The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents however 
 The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms
 of a house to live in money to purchase food    without food stamps   
 and the beginning of a family focused on success not hopelessness 
 Wont you help make all of these successes possible  Please send the
 largest contribution you can comfortably make Your gift will help give
 new meaning to the word success    for people who have seldom had reason
 to use the word 
 Sincerely 
 James M McClelland President
 P S Your gift will make a difference For every dollar of public
 support Goodwill received last year we returned to the community
 in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments 
 
 

 
 
 
 Some of the strongest critics of our welfare system are the people who
 have become dependent on it 
 Their complaint the system discourages working because unemployment
 provides benefits that many entry level jobs don’t include 
 that’s where you   and Goodwill   come in We help people train for
 and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare Last
 year Goodwill placed people in jobs more than double the number we
 placed in 
 While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea 
 the people who need jobs are floundering We need your support to
 continue getting people off of public assistance 
 Welfare is not the answer And welfare reform is an uncertain solution
 with an unknown starting date Goodwill works Right now 
 Please give the largest gift you can to Goodwill today 
 Sincerely 
 Jack Dustman Chairman

 Dear Name 
 When Jerry was released from prison he knew it would take hard work
 and determination to straighten out his life He knew he had made a bad
 mistake but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life he just
 didn’t count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path 
 Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up
 on the street He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps
 until he could find a job and a place to live The Trustee referred him
 to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwills Career Academy staff
 for job search assistance 
 Jerrys Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately But Jerrys
 troubles didn’t end there The seasonal construction job he obtained soon
 ended and he returned to Career Academy for help once more Unemployed 
 homeless and with a prison record Jerry now faced going back to prison
 for failure to pay child support 
 It took some time and hard work but with the help of Goodwill Jerry
 was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutors office find
 housing and conduct a more thorough job search 
 With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana 
 many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment Of the
 more than people Goodwill served in over of them have
 multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job Some like Jerry are
 ex offenders Some are blind deaf or have other physical disabilities 
 More than were homeless 
 But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to
 overcome like Jerry With a promising new job at a plastic injection
 molding manufacturer his legal troubles in check and a safe place to
 live Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself
 and contributing to his community For as long as he needs it Goodwill
 will continue to help 
 Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement
 services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful
 employment And with your assistance Goodwill can help employers
 develop resources to keep workers on the job 
 Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending
 a gift to Goodwill Your generosity will help people help themselves

 Dear 
 Do you remember the combination of elation and apprehension you felt
 when you first left home  The young adults who leave Pleasant Run have
 those same feelings Very few have family support to get them started 
 Many need furniture linens and other basic necessities to begin lives on
 their own 
 To help them establish themselves in the community the Pleasant Run
 Emancipation fund was begun in by private donors who wanted to
 provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our
 programs 
 Individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to
 from the Fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements 
 Release by the courts Successful completion of all life skills tests
 Positive termination of his or her Pleasant Run program Possession
 of a high school diploma or GED
 Proof of meeting these two staff reference letters and an essay
 stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all
 reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel which determines if the applicant
 merits the funds 
 Such fund are often used for college tuition vocational training or a
 deposit on an apartment 
 Because Pleasant Run is the only  family  for so many our
 Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first
 steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive
 adult 
 Without private donor support this Fund doesn’t exist Please take a
 few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children
 successfully cross that threshold into the future

 Dear Friend 
 What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run
 Childrens Homes 
 Little ones like Baby Jessica caught in the struggle between
 adoptive and birth parents Older kids like Tracy and Kerry left
 homeless after a recent murder suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and
 Dad Young adults like Mary T a jobless mother of three trying
 desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime ridden
 neighborhood Real people 
 There are thousands more Families are being torn apart and too
 often children are the victims Kids like Tommie J made a ward of the
 court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father Alice sent to
 a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders and John
 H a recovering alcoholic rebuilding a relationships with his family so
 they can live together again 
 Pleasant Run Childrens Homes began serving children nearly years
 ago Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil
 War Today we serve children and families with a multitude of problems 
 emotional physical psychological and sexual abuse Some come from
 families where through therapy there is hope for reunification For
 others  families  are the counselors are housemates at the group homes
 where they live 
 The biggest tragedy is that the problems don’t go away they only
 grow In Pleasant Run served children and families In 
 we will serve over children and families In these figures
 will triple The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given
 the opportunity to become happy loving and productive members of our
 society They welcome the chance to belong to become self  sufficient 
 to regain their self esteem and confidence Often it is a long hard
 struggle but the results are well worth it 
 For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children
 and their families we need your support The Funding sources are
 shrinking but the needs grow explosively Please  help good kids get
 better  by sending us a contribution today Your gift will give children
 and families hope for improved tomorrows

 Dear Friend 
 This is not newsletter It is a fund raising appeal 
 But theres no reason why we shouldnt share good news at the same
 time Federal state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing
 much needed funding sources for people who are truly in need In spite of
 that Pleasant Run Childrens Homes with the help of hundreds of
 volunteers and others who really care continues to make a significant
 impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help 
 We all hear about todays increases in neglect abuse and abandonment
 of those who cant fight back children Yet few of us hear enough about
 kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade 
 The positive side These are special children They come into a
 Pleasant Run program whether its for therapeutic help in their own
 homes which nurtures whole families through foster care families or in
 the familial surroundings of our residential homes 
 For some its a matter of weeks or months for others its years 
 They leave Pleasant Run generally ready and able to contribute to
 society Were proud of our children and all that they overcome 
 We are a not for profit multi service agency We would’nt  exist if
 the need werent there The numbers of children who deserve our services
 are rising as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them 
 Please help us help them Pleasant Run Childrens Homes  where good
 kids get better

 Dear Friends of Pleasant Run 
 The holiday season is the time of year when were all busy buying
 gifts baking goodies decorating our homes and making arrangements to be
 with family and friends This is the time of year when we give thanks for
 the warmth and love that surrounds us And this time of year is an
 occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are 
 Pleasant Run cares for at risk children and families We do this
 through a wide range of programs including community  based therapeutic
 foster care group homes and our treatment center Many of the children
 are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes 
 Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a
 contribution to Pleasant Run to help the children families we care
 for Many of the children have no homes no memories of joy from past
 holidays Others are from families that are struggling to provide a
 healthy happy environment but don’t have the resources to make it
 possible Your contribution will make a difference in a childs life It
 may help a family stay together It can certainly make happy holiday
 memories 
 A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have
 presents to open A gift means a family will have a holiday meal cooking
 utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on Your gift will go
 beyond the holiday season It can help purchase clothing school
 supplies books and educational tools throughout the year 
 
 Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run Let our
 families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of
 memories of the holidays you will have 
 We wish you and your family a new year full of joy and love 
 Sincerely

 Its hard to believe that the holiday season is only two months away 
 At Pleasant Run Inc we are making plans and arrangements for our
 children and families 
 Every year we seek companies organizations and individuals to sponsor
 one or more of our families These families are participants in our
 community based programs These programs focus on keeping the family
 together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family 
 After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they
 often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils 
 beds cleaning supplies etc We meet these needs immediately But the
 holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families They
 do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a
 holiday meal 
 We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this
 holiday season If you are interested and would like more information 
 please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at   We would like to
 have families matched with sponsors non later than xxxx Thank you for
 considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for

 Dear Name 
 What a Summer 
 And were just getting started 
 I hope youll consider continuing your support of Jamesons special
 campers by renewing your last gift of xxx I can tell you we need your
 help now as much as ever before 
 All of our Six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity and 
 truth be told with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed
 in and we have a waiting list of children who are hoping to come if a
 spot should open Many more camper referrals are coming from new
 organizations such as school social workers and family counseling
 agencies It seems summer options arent readily available for troubled
 kids whose families have limited incomes so were doing all we can to
 make Jameson available 
 That  we  includes the Youth Leadership teens These or so campers
 have takenon a fund raiser with a goal of raising for
 camperships Two of them told me yesterday that as a group they decided
 they had to earn the right to ask others for help by accomplishing
 something real to help themselves And that’s from kids many people see
 as a problem 
 Even after the summer sessions come to a close Jameson campers will
 take part in year round programs designed to keep that positive contact
 with peers and role models alive and important Weve scheduled more than
 follow up camper weekends beginning in September and going around till
 next summers camping season 
 Please consider renewing your support of these great kids today 
 Sincerely 
 Julie Marsh Executive Director
 P S We know our follow up weekends are going to be better attended
 than ever this fall and winter If you can give a little more to help
 meet this increased expense we would appreciate your support

 Dear Mrs Name 
 Confidence An understanding that above anything else success
 requires genuine effort a willingness to set challenging goals Caring
 about others 
 These are the attributes we want all children to have You help
 Jameson campers reach for them If these special children are to become
 the adults we all need them to be we have to lead them in the right
 direction right now 
 Jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and I
 hope youll continue your support this year you’re last gift of 
 helped make it possible for us to provide guidance encouragement and fun
 to nearly Indianapolis area children And not just during the summer 
 but throughout the year 
 What has your support of our campers meant to them and what have they
 been able to accomplish because you care 
 The best indicator I can give you of the positive effect our
 year round contact has is the growth in and deeds of the Youth Leadership
 teens In just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids
 and a few extra activities to a team of almost young adults taking on
 real projects YL teens will make J C juniors happen again this year for
 and year old campers A five day camp J C juniors introduces
 at risk children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously
 reach them That means we now have the opportunity to be a stable 
 positive and important part of each childs life for an entire
 decade 
 The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for
 other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them And their
 activities arent isolated to Jameson The teens have undertaken a
 volunteer project to regularly visit with sick children at a local
 hospital 
 Please consider renewing your gift today The kids need your
 leadership now more than ever If you can increase your last donation we
 would appreciate that show of support for the campers and their efforts
 to overcome obstacles and create successful lives 
 Thank you again for helping point the way 
 Sincerely 
 Julie Marsh Executive Director
 P S You make it possible for us to help special kids with learning
 disabilities behavior problems and economic disadvantages to gain the
 confidence required to put genuine effort into achieving real goals I
 hope youll continue    and if possible increase   your support for these
 great kids

 bring more money into our centers This in turn will help us to increase
 and even improve the services we offer 
 With this in mind I am asking each one of you to make a personal
 contribution of or even to show that you believe in the
 work that we do and are willing to support it with both your time and
 your finances This way when we go out to ask for community support and

 commitment through board participation I also encourage you to seek
 additional support through your company church or service
 organization 
 I know that our staff and committee members will be happy to go with

 The goal of MCCOY Inc has been to make a difference In MCCOY 
 Inc led two efforts that we believe will help our community continue
 to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop
 well 
 Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified
 three goals for all our youth to obtain economic self sufficiency 
 healthy family social relationships and involvement in the community A
 short time later the Community Youth Mapping Project sent young
 people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow
 up well caring adults safe places to go and positive things to do 
 One group of adults and one group of youth through two very different
 processes have arrived at the same conclusion our community still has
 much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into
 the responsible productive adults who will our community in the
 future 
 As a provider of youth services MCCOY Inc is here to support your
 valuable efforts to develop young people Recently through a lot of hard
 work and alliances with organizations like yours some steps have been
 taken in our community that will help young people continue to be
 involved in positive activities One IndyGo in April adopted a
 much needed policy that all young people under the age of may ride on
 their buses at half the normal fare all year long Two funding was made
 available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct
 positive youth programming on Saturday evenings Through the youth
 mapping process it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for
 youth on weekend evenings were lacking That need is being met 
 As it has been an exciting year for all of us MCCOY Inc cannot do
 its part without the support of organizations like yours Annually we
 ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort
 to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis Enclosed is a donation
 card that will enable you to make Indianapolis a great place for ALL of
 us to live If you have any questions or concerns at any time please do
 not hesitate to call me at

 Dear Bill 
 This is the time of year when our thoughts turn to ways to do things
 differently things that will make our lives better and improve the
 quality of our life As you begin that process this year I would like to
 ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more
 positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County
 Commission on Youth Inc 
 MCCOY Inc originally founded as a government agency but re organized
 in as an independent not for profit is a county wide youth services
 coordinating planning and convening agency Its purpose is to encourage
 collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies programs and
 systems that serve our communitys youth In addition to that
 behind the scenes role MCCOY has taken an out front role in developing a
 Summer Bus Pass neighborhood youth councils and the We Value Youth
 information line It is our goal that every young person in Marion County
 have access to the programs and services that can best assist them in
 their growth toward a positive adulthood 
 I am hopeful that you as an individual and Meridian Insurance as a
 corporation might consider becoming sustaining supporters of MCCOY I
 have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as
 an application with various options for supporting the youth of our
 community 
 I obviously cant tell the whole story of MCCOY in a single letter but
 I hope this provides an overview of the scope of our work I will call
 you in a few weeks to discuss your level of interest Please consider
 joining together with your fellow citizens in support of the work of the
 Marion County Commission on Youth 
 Sincerely 
 John Brandon Executive Director

 Name Address City ST Zip
 Dear Name 
 In the summer of the Marion County Commission on Youth began
 what can best be described as a  new era  in its history MCCOY was
 reorganized as an independent not for profit agency separate from local
 government It retained however the same mission with which it had been
 charged from its inception to serve as a catalyst for effective 
 coordinated and collaborative service delivery to youth in our
 community 
 For the past three years MCCOY has been actively engaged in
 accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others 
 youth service providers youth funding bodies and interested citizens
 to name a few 
 We have met with a number of successes along the way most notably the
 Summer Fun Line the Metro Summer Bus Pass and the development of ten
 neighborhood youth councils A Providers Council and a Youth Coalition
 are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the
 years to come The formation of The Community Academy a pilot project
 directed at expelled students from local school systems has come about
 as a result of MCCOYs efforts to mobilize community agencies in response
 to a pressing issue 
 McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community
 collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the
 inclusion of young people in both decision making and program planning
 processes One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the
 United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of
 Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne 
 Indiana As a team these three organizations are working with
 neighborhood youth and adults to build a  Caring Neighborhood with Youth 
 mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a
 better neighborhood for all 
 Since its re organization MCCOY has established its unique niche
 within the community by refraining from direct service programming and
 focusing on what it does best helping to identify youth needs convening
 groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs 
 and moving toward collaborative solutions McCoy has only one interest 
 the well being of Marion Countys young people 
 McCoy invites the support of The    Company Foundation in the amount
 of to support such activities as 
      the co ordination of youth leadership training and youth
 empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of
 neighborhood based youth councils      the promotion of youth employment
 opportunities      the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding
 effective and efficient youth service delivery 
      the provision of technical assistance and guidance to
 neighborhoods which seek positive youth adult relationships 
      the development of community wide supports for the positive
 growth of all Marion County young people 
 In the last several years the business and corporate community has
 recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to
 the development of a competent workforce Youth who are supported and
 encouraged by both a family and a society that values
 
 Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and
 contributing members of adult society While we have made significant
 inroads there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do
 it alone We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be
 successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people
 can grow and develop well Your contribution will enable us to both
 continue and expand the good work we have begun in making Indianapolis a
 city famous for its commitment to youth and families 
 In our fund raising efforts to date we have received the support of
 local government foundations and corporations as well as the personal
 financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members We believe there
 is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative
 effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community
 as a whole 
 Thanking you in advance for your support we remain

 Dear Name 
 Its tough growing up today We know that children do better when they
 have a network of caring adults to nurture and motivate them When young
 people don’t have that support they need other resources for
 encouragement to guide them along the way Big Sisters helps bridge that
 gap by providing children with the resources they need    Big Sisters
 volunteers 
 Big Sisters are mentors and friends who empower girls to more fully
 reach their potential experience lifes opportunities and perhaps begin
 to dream The relationships that are formed provide strong foundations
 from which healthy values and strong self confidence can grow helping
 youth become strong independent adults of tomorrow 
 This year we will serve over girls through our mentoring
 programs This is an impressive number but for each girl served more
 are left unserved Over girls are currently waiting for a Big
 Sister 
 You can make an impact by supporting Big Sisters Annual Campaign and
 our goal If you are a regular contributor to the Annual
 Campaign I encourage you to consider increasing your gift by If you
 have not supported Big Sisters in the past please join me in doing so by
 completing and returning the enclosed pledge form 
 Early adolescence is the most vulnerable age for youth But caring
 adults like you can reach out and help Its the perfect time to make a
 world of difference

 Dear Friend 
 Adolescence It is a pivotal time in the life of a young girl when
 small changes in her behavior or the choices she makes can affect her
 future Its hard enough for her to make good decisions when shes
 surrounded by support Its even harder when she isn’t 
 Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring responsible adult
 volunteers with at risk girls ages   A Big Sister is a mentor a
 friend and a role model helping a young girl to develop the
 self confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible 
 productive and successful adult Your contribution can put a
 mentor in a childs life and hope in a childs future 
 The results of an  month study completed by Public Private Ventures
 showed that children participating in one to one Big Sister and Big
 Brother matches for just one year reduced first time drug use by 
 lowered school absenteeism by cut aggressive behavior by 
 enhanced school performance and improved relations with family and
 friends 
 This is positive proof that Big Sisters one to one mentoring program
 helps change lives Today we are offering you the opportunity to help
 change a life By contributing you can support one match for one
 year This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports
 the development of effective relationships This includes a volunteer
 screening process orientation training and ongoing supervision and
 support by a professional staff 
 As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of  your match  and be
 identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office in the
 agency newsletter and annual report 
 Today Big Sisters serves over girls in central Indiana But for
 each girl served more are left unserved Over girls are currently
 waiting for a Big Sister Imagine the difference the community could make
 if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match 
 I encourage you to Join me in presenting this matchmaker challenge to
 your congregation

 Dear Mr Philanthropy 
  The urgency you feel to make changes is just the extent that change
 will be made Do not sit this one out Do not play it safe Understand
 the world and change it where it needs to be changed Make our society
 better Make a world worthy of the children that your generation will
 bear      Carl Sagan
 You can help make positive changes in the lives of at risk youth in
 central Indiana We often hear about economic poverty but what some of
 these young people are growing up with is emotional poverty they have
 often given up on hope and the possibility of a successful future With
 your help we can change that 
 Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full
 of hope and with a positive outlook Thanks to our Big Sisters
 volunteers these young people are self confident believe in themselves
 and are beginning to realize their full potential A recent study by
 Public Private Ventures PPV showed that girls who had a Big Sister for
 just one year 
 reduced first time drug use by lowered school absenteeism by 
 cut violent behavior by enhanced school performance showed improved
 peer and family relationships
 Former Little Sister Amy now  years old is a testament to the Big
 Sisters program 
  I was matched with my Big Sister in June of Since then she and
 I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new
 things We go to movies dinner concerts and other stuff like that but
 I have also been able to participate in charity events and fundraiser
 type things 
 Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister but I learned a
 lot from her too I have become more open minded more responsible and 
 most importantly I have gained a lot more self confidence I am very
 thankful to the Big Sisters program for allowing me this very special
 opportunity 
 In Big Sisters served young people through its many
 programs But the need is still great Over young people are still
 waiting for a mentor 
 You are an important part in making sure these young people are
 matched with caring adult mentors Will you make a financial gift to Big
 Sisters in that will ensure that more young people receive the
 guidance they need that more young people stay in school stay off drugs
 and make good choices 
 Your contribution will be used to recruit and retain quality
 volunteers It will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that
 fosters and supports the development of effective relationships 
 including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and
 support by a professional staff This year your gift can go farther 
 Gifts of or more will be matched thanks to a special th
 Anniversary Challenge Grant and will be placed in the Growth For
 Girls Fund This fund will support the goal of having mentoring
 relationships by the end of and by the end of

 much for your time attention and consideration

 His belly was empty So empty it hurt 
 At least Astro could drink water from a puddle
 near the stake he was chained to But then
 the puddle dried up Astro had only a few days to live 
 
 
 Dear Friend 
 
 As you read my letter somewhere    perhaps not far from you   someone is inflicting pain on an innocent animal an animal like Astro 
 
 You may not be able to rescue that particular animal But you CAN join the crusade to stop animal abuse and neglect by making a generous contribution to the ASPCA today 
 
 I have sent you the enclosed complimentary name and address labels to call your attention to the work of the ASPCA Please USE them on your correspondence to help get our name in front of as many people as possible Because the ASPCA    and the thousands of animals we help every year   need all the friends we can get 
 
 As a person who cares about animals you’re probably anxious to know what happened to Astro A neighbor reported Astros plight to the ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers went to investigate 
 
 When our officers arrived Astro was too weak to even stand up The officers knelt down slowly speaking gently to the emaciated dog 
 
 Then they saw it Astro was wagging his tail He was barely moving but yes    the poor sick dog was saying  Welcome friends 
 
 The officers brought Astro to the ASPCAs Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital The dog weighted only pounds    less than half of what a dog his size should weigh    and he had several infections But with first rate medical attention and tender care from ASPCA staff he slowly got well again 
 
 Stories like Astros are all too common Every day the ASPCA gets reports of animal cruelty abuse and neglect Every day our officers rescue animals like Sammy a  month old kitten who was deliberately thrown from a high rise window by teenagers 
 
 In a world where cruelty is common animals like Sammy and Astro desperately need friends like you That is why I have written to you    to ask you to support the ASPCA today 
 
 Our vital anti cruelty efforts are just part of the ASPCA mission We also find loving adoptive homes for rescued animals provide first rate veterinary care through our Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital offer low cost spay and neuter programs for cats and dogs reach out to children teachers and parents through our Education Programs 
 
 And we don’t stop there The ASPCA pushes for the passage and strengthening of anti cruelty laws so that crimes against animals will be treated with the seriousness they deserve 
 
 Since the ASPCA was founded in as America s first humane society ending cruelty has been our primary goal Today over years later the scope of the problem is greater than ever 
 
 The ASPCA urgently needs your help to push back the tide of violence against animals The task is too large for the ASPCA to handle without emergency assistance from dedicated friends That is why i’m asking you to join the ASPCA today with your gift of or more if at all possible 
 
 Your contribution will help us rescue more animals like Astro make sure the perpetrators of cruelty are brought to justice nurse abused animals back to health and find them loving adoptive homes Please help the ASPCA with your most generous gift today    the animals are counting on you 
 
 Sincerely 
 
 
 
 Hawk DVM
 and CEO
 
 
 P S We found Astro a wonderful adoptive home He is the pride and joy of this loving family But thousands more animals are in peril of losing their lives    you can help the ASPCA reach out to them by returning the enclosed reply form with your gift today Please accept the enclosed name stickers as our gift to you and use them to spread the word about the ASPCA and the animals we help    thank you

 i’m outraged and I think you will be too 
 
 Just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds    among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slow acting poison spread in fields miles away 
 
 And who plans to commit such a mass bird killing 
 
 The U S Department of Agriculture 
 
 In fact the USDA has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout the northern Great Plains targeting two million migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly other bird species 
 
 its almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented    in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like DDT have had on wildlife and people 
 
 Thanks to the help of caring and concerned people like you Audubon won a temporary halt to this planned killing last spring    but the USDAs plans could be up and running for the next blackbird migration unless we act now 
 
 Let me tell you exactly whats at stake and how this could set a dangerous precedent First of all you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the Migratory Bird Treaty Acts prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm 
 
 You see the USDA found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for  experimental activities 
 
 So they applied for the right to spread poison as Dart of a  scientific experiment    to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss 
 
 Can you believe it  The USDA wants to conduct an  experiment that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds 
 
 And if the death of two million birds doesn’t  prove their theory    and show a reduction in crop loss    theyll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year 
 
 Its time to tell the USDA in no uncertain terms 
 
  YOU WILL NOT CONDUCT MASSIVE BIRD KILLS
 
 TO BENEFIT A HANDFUL OF SPECIAL INTERESTS 
 
 Because the USDAs slow acting pesticide takes three days to kill its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields before falling to the ground 
 
 Meanwhile blackbirds arent the only birds threatened directly by the poison Weve noted the presence of other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poison baited areas including the Bobolink Grasshopper Sparrow Harris Sparrow and Le Contes Sparrow 
 
 In all nine birds on the Federal threatened or endangered lists and birds on Audubons WatchList of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields 
 
 We simply cannot afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife 
 
 here’s what I need you to do to make sure we prevail First I need you to sign and return your Petition to the U S Secretary of Agriculture 
 
 Ill forward your Petition along with those from thousands of other Audubon members and supporters urging the USDA to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds in favor of alternative benign methods of protecting sunflower crops 
 
 I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make a difference    just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago 
 
 But todays battle is one we must win to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment 
 
 that’s why I hope youll also agree to help even more by making a tax deductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of Audubons vital conservation work to protect birds other wildlife and habitat And with a donation of or more youll receive a FREE Birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern 
 
 Ill make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to 
 
  Win a ban on the USDA bird poisoning 
  Gain strict enforcement of wildlife laws 
  Ensure wildlife programs are based on sound science 
  Monitor the health of Audubons WatchList species 
  Conserve Americas remaining grassland habitat 
 
 And Audubon will draw upon its century long track record of highly effective conservation work to make a real difference in other key areas 
 
 Audubon protects birds Your help will be instrumental to our bird conservation work designating Important Bird Areas to protect vital habitat maintaining the WatchList of bird species near endangered status www audubon org  bird watch and engaging citizen participation in the vast BirdSource database of North American bird trends 
 
 Audubon rescues endangered wildlife Nearly years ago the National Audubon Society helped win passage of the Endangered Species Act With your help Audubon will remain committed to wildlife laws and regulations that are well funded properly implemented and strongly enforced 
 
 Audubon establishes and protects wildlife refuges and sanctuaries  Audubon is truly making a difference for wildlife refuges everywhere says U S Fish and Wildlife official Rick Coleman And your support will help sustain our innovative Audubon Refuge Keepers program and maintain our own network of more than wildlife centers and sanctuaries 
 
 Audubon restores wetlands Wetlands are not only crucial to wildlife they also help purify our drinking water and prevent billions of dollars worth of flood damage Your gift today will help us reach our goal to restore one million acres of irreplaceable wetlands 
 
 Audubon educates the public Teaching Americans   particularly young people    how to become better stewards of our environment is one of the best investments that you and I can make for wildlife that’s why were expanding our network of Audubon Centers to reach children and adults in every corner of the nation 
 
 And of course your support will enable Audubon to stand ready to act whenever a wildlife crisis emerges
   like the USDAs bird poisoning proposal that i’m asking you to help us defeat today 
 
 So let me urge you to do your part by supporting a group that the San Francisco Chronicle calls  one of Americas most respected and influential conservation organizations 
 
 First sign and return your Petition to the Secretary of Agriculture immediately to declare a firm and resounding  NO  to the USDAs bird poisoning plan 
 
 And I also hope youll take a second important step today by supporting Audubons vital conservation work with a generous tax deductible gift Thank you 
 
 Very truly yours

 ALASKA EMERGENCY
 Dear Defender 
 Look closely at this photo and youll see a wolf running Soon this wolf wont be merely running in the snow 
 This wolf will be running for its life 
 The airplane above will be tracking her in order to land and immediately gun her down 
 
 You see the Alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a trapping or hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down This cruel unethical wolf hunting practice is called  same day airborne land and shoot 
 It was a total shock and surprise 
 In May the Alaska legislature voted to reinstate same day airborne wolf killing Frankly we never thought Alaskas anti wolf politicians would go this far But they did overriding Governor Tony Knowles veto   and ignoring the will of the majority of Alaskas citizens 
 Unfortunately this practice will begin after the first snow this September when wolves will be  cant miss targets against Alaskas snowy terrain Wolves can run fast   but they certainly cant outrun airplanes 
 Given the urgency of the situation in Alaska Defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save Alaskas wolves from same day airborne land and shoot slaughter 
 Support the Emergency Effort to Save Alaskas Wolves 
 
 Defenders hopes to raise at least to help Alaskans For Wildlife a coalition of Alaska citizens win a citizens ballot initiative this November And we face very wealthy opponents So today I urge you to do these two things 
 FIRST Sign the enclosed Citizens Advisory Ballot to show our Alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on  same day airborne
 land and shoot wolf killing in Alaska 
 SECOND Rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in November 
 The Alaska Legislature is completely out of step with the will of Alaskas citizens and the American public at large 
 Like you the majority of Alaskans oppose same day land and shoot wolf killing But the anti wolf politicians in the Alaska legislature don’t care what the majority of Alaska citizens want And they didn’t listen to the recommendations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game which opposed this legislation 
 They are utterly out of step with their Alaska constituents the state agency that manages Alaska wildlife and the rest of the American public 
 In the name of  wolf control  wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion so that the wolves have literally no chance of survival 
 And if history is any guide over the years thousands of Alaskas wolves will be brutally killed 
 Before the ban on same day land and shoot as many as wolves were killed in Alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice 
 Anti wolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new land and shoot law stands   even though most Alaskans do not support it 
 So if we don’t act right now Alaskas snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in Americas  Last Frontier 
 Say  NO to the barbaric practice of same day airborne wolf killing 
 The only way Alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on same day airborne land and shoot wolf killing is with a Citizens Referendum 
 that’s why your special financial support is so important   and urgently needed 
 Alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves 
 As I mentioned this new same day airborne land and shoot practice will start in September after the opening of hunting season and the first snow   and when wolves will be an easy target 
 To repeal this unconscionable law Defenders must help provide our friends in Alaska    Alaskans For Wildlife   with the resources necessary to win at the polls in November 
 Our well funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure We need help to supplement the funds raised by Alaskans For Wildlife for careful polling the development of voter education spots for television radio and newspapers the placement of those ads and  get out the vote efforts on election day 
 If Alaskas new law is not replaced thousands of Alaskas wolves will die in the years to come 
 And it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide   at a time when the American public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection A loss will encourage those anti wolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild 
 So please don’t wait another minute 
 Please sign your Citizens Advisory Ballot to demonstrate to our Alaska allies that you’re behind them and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort 
 So how will your money be spent 
 here’s the projected budget breakdown 
   in depth state wide survey conducted by a top pollster to determine voters positions on the ballot measure and arguments that will help persuade undecided voters 
   salaries  office expenses for staff to oversee the effort between now and election day 
   production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey 
   placement of voter education spots in the key media including print radio and television Money must be in hand by mid August to reserve time for September and October 
   election day  get out the vote drive including phone calls to get voters to the polls 
 You stood by Defenders when we defeated the wealthy American Farm Bureau in court and saved the lives of the wolves in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho 
 Now i’m hoping I can count on your moral and financial support again today to help save Alaskas wolves from same day airborne land and shoot killing 
 Your special donation today is absolutely critical because many of Alaskas politicians clearly have anti wolf agendas They have the financial backing of powerful special interests and the determination to ignore the will of the people of Alaska and the American public 
 Please let Alaskans know that you’re behind them Let them know you share their concern about protecting Alaskas wolves 
 Please help save Alaskas wolves by doing these two things 
 SIGN the enclosed Citizens Advisory Ballot to show your support
 for repealing  same day airborne land and shoot wolf killing in Alaska 
 RUSH a special donation to help our Alaska allies overturn this odious new law 
 Remember for this emergency effort to succeed we must act immediately 
 So please take out your pen right now and sign your absentee ballot And then mail it back to us along with your emergency donation to help save Alaskas wolves 
 Thank you for your strong support 
 Sincerely 
 Rodger Schlickeisen
 President
 P S 	Defenders needs your help to raise in emergency funds to help ensure that the coalitions Emergency Effort to Save Alaskas Wolves succeeds So please sign the
 enclosed Citizens Advisory Ballot to lend your moral support to our Alaska friends and return it in the enclosed envelope with a special donation Time is so short 
 
 
 




For The Blind Inc 
 EASIJERICHO TURNPIKE SMITHIOWN NEW YORK   
Its people like you who make it possible to give the priceless gift of 
 Second Sight 
Dear Friend 
Think what it would be like to live in a world of dark shapes and shadows where you
never know what to expect to feel afraid to go places to be hesitant about every
step you take For too many this is a daily reality   but today you can help make a
difference 
Having a guide dog allows a blind or visually impaired individual to experience the
possibilities of life not the limitations 
It costs over to breed care for and train a guide dog like  Duke and to
train his blind teammate We use Labrador Retrievers Golden Retrievers and a cross
between Labs and Goldens Male and female dogs are used And our dogs are specially
bred for temperament and physical soundness 
Every Foundation guide dog is given free of charge to someone who is blind or
visually impaired 
We are supported entirely by donations from generous individuals corporations and
foundations We receive no government funding 
The only way we can continue to provide guide dogs at no cost to someone who is
blind or visually impaired is through your support 

Friends like you make it possible to give the gift of  Second Sight® I hope the
Foundation can count on your caring donation today Many people send gifts of 
 or even or more   whatever you are able to give to help
maintain this vital service 

And having a guide dog does make a real difference in the lives of our students Its
the special bond   of a loving and working hour a day partnership 
 As a boy in Bosnia I walked my dog Now my guide dog Franklin walks me says
Sead He was blinded at by a Serbian missile  After I got my beautiful black Lab 
I finally felt like a human being again Now I believe almost anything is possible 
Franklin has opened up a whole new world for me A world I thought I would never have
again 
As Pat explains  Both my friends were zipping through crowds while I lagged behind 
even though I was a fast cane walker I envied their freedom and most of all the

 Dear Friend of Animals 
 
 I hope youll use the enclosed name labels and colorful pet stickers designed especially for friends of animals 
 
 Your name    and the name of The Humane Society of the United States HSUS    are very important to the well being of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives 
 
 I wish I could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earths animals    dogs cats farm animals and wildlife The sad truth is animal cruelty abuse and neglect continues at an alarming rate across the nation and even in your own community 
 
 Every day of the year The Humane Society of the United States receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties such as the horrors of the leghold trap the use of dog and cat fur needless or repetitive experiments on animals and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats 
 
 Still others are less obvious but just as horrible dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers baby calves confined and malnourished to provide  milk fed veal for the gourmet and the  accidental drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen And almost companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America 
 
 What is even more shocking is that more than million animals die these cruel painful deaths each year needless deaths that could have been stopped 
 
 And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on i’m sure you can understand why the work of The Humane Society of the United States is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people like you to help us bring an end to animal suffering abuse and neglect 
 
 Since our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties 
 
 We also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty 
 
 Our primary goal though has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering abuse and exploitation 
 
 But while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources 
 Its a difficult problem because we have to fight the well financed and powerful agri business and research industries but we do our best to protect the animals 
 
 Right now the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty 
 
 And that’s where you can help You can be a lifesaving  friend to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of The HSUS and asking them to become vigilant in safe guarding the lives of ALL animals 
 
 Today we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption I hope you will visit your local animal shelter and consider adopting a dog or cat into your home Its a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal too 
 
 I also hope you will give a big boost to our work to protect all animals by sending a generous tax deductible donation today Your gift of at least or or even will help The HSUS save millions of animals 
 
 I know you care deeply for the well being of all animals Please help us carry this message to others so that animal cruelty and abuse can be eliminated 
 
 Sincerely 
 
 
 President
 
 P S We are totally committed to putting an end to all forms of animal cruelty and neglect But your help of or or even is absolutely needed today Please take this moment to be as generous as possible to send your best gift today and don’t forget to use your free colorful pet stickers and name labels enclosed Thanks in advance

 Your donation will help give an animal a safe home 
 Dear Ms LastName
 I wanted to personally write you and give you our Collectible Calendar and talk about animals in danger   a cause we both care deeply about 
 Please take a moment to look over the enclosed Animal Sanctuary Calendar Be sure to write me back to let me know your Calendar has arrived m good order i’m sure you will want to keep it and prominently display it to enjoy these striking wildlife images 
 don’t you agree that the lion and baby seal are looking right into your eyes  The mother elephant has a watchful eye on her young calf And if you have ever experienced to sight of a diving dolphin you will be brought instantly back to that exciting moment when turning to our August image 
 Can you imagine the lion on our calendar cover being cruelly killed for a hunters trophy 
 Can you imagine the baby seal crying out for fear as a sealer raises his club 
 Can you picture the baby elephant and mother with no place safe to rest and find water 
 Many of our critics say that you and I who love animals attribute intelligent and sensitive qualities to  stupid non feeling animals But our ability to feel the fear and know the pain that animals experience is no  error in judgement nor  overblown sentimentality it is real It is humane 
 The International Fund for Animal Welfare is one of the largest most effective animal welfare organizations in the world with a special mission to save animals lives prevent cruelty and protect natural habitat for wildlife to live and enjoy life in harmony with man 
 Too too often man has not been a good neighbor to animals Whether we talk about clubbing baby seals to death for their beautiful pelts or butchering elephants with hacksaws for their ivory or trapping animals in steel jaw leghold traps where the pain is so excruciating they have been known to chew off a leg to escape we stand guard for all animals 
 All animals need a place to  get to in order to be safe from bullets cruelty traps and clubs 
 IFAW P O Box I Yarmouth Port MA   www lfaw org
 IFAW is now launching our year Animal Sanctuary Fund to provide safe places for animals to live out of the danger tat comes from humans and loss of habitat This is a new special project that has been expanded into a permanent program 
 Whether it is to fund additional land for the Addo elephant park in South Africa where calves were born this year or our partnership with Future Generations to save vital habitat for moon bears bengal tigers and other animals or our response to move orphaned lions to acres of protected African bush where they will live safely for the rest of their lives  we are committed to the concept of ANIMAL SANCTUARIES 
 i’m positive you agree with this most basic humane approach I wont even ask if you support this program but rather I must ask how much you can afford to support this Animal Sanctuary Fund today 
 I do not like to ask for money No one does But money gives us the POWER TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE VOICELESS 
 Will you please join with me today to help save animals from pain suffering hunger hunting and abuse 
 Your gift will help give an animal a safe home 
 Be absolutely sure your donations do save lives For years our name has been associated throughout the world wit saving innocent animals Many people know us as the Save the Seals people and we have saved thousands of animals   seals elephants cats dogs bears whales This new program will be a huge success with your help 
 I thought you would enjoy our Animal Sanctuary Calendar It is a unique gift to you for taking your time to hear my vision of new safety for the worlds animals and my request for your hard earned money
 The simple fact is we cannot continue without your generous gifts Gifts of and all are important to keep our Animal Sanctuary Fund operating 
 Please rush me your generous gift of or today while these endangered animals are on your mind and in your heart 
 Animals don’t ask for much of us All they need is safe homeland and freedom from pain and fear Your donation today could save a life tomorrow
 For the animals

 Dear Friend 
 
 As a member of World Wildlife Fund you know that our efforts are essential to preserving the astonishing 
 yet desperately threatened diversity of life here on Earth 

 i’m also hoping you know that you play a vital role in achieving our conservation goals around the
 globe 

 that’s why I want to extend my appreciation for your last membership contribution of And
 why i’m writing you today to ask you to renew your support for the pivotal year ahead 

 In fact I want to urge you to strengthen your dedication to saving life on Earth   by sending a generous
 leadership gift of and becoming a member of World Wildlife Funds prestigious Living Planet Society 

 With your increased commitment we can move forward to thwart the most serious threats to endangered
 ecosystems After all conservation begins with saving those at risk places    our forests and deserts wetlands and oceans mangroves and coral reefs   that provide a lifeline for
 precious animals and plants 

 To this end weve designated some ecoregions those with the most outstanding and diverse habitats as
 our Global Were now creating model projects in of these high priority areas    in order to balance
 conservation with peoples need to use natural resources to sustain their livelihoods 

 With your increased commitment we can intensify our campaigns to protect species that are in grave peril by
 both the loss of habitat and the illegal trading in animal parts 

 Quite simply WWF must do even more to safeguard the tigers rhinos pandas whales and other creatures
 that still remain in the wild While we still have the chance 

 So in addition to our efforts to conserve wildlife preserves well escalate our trailblazing program to
 find alternatives for traditional tiger based medicines rescue more rhinos in Kenya and Nepal through our
 ambitious translocation projects complete the first survey of Chinas pandas in over a decade and fight
 to halt all commercial whaling as well as the whale meat trade 

 Well also award more small grants through our Species Action Fund to help a wide range of animals 
 including whooping cranes giant river otters and Tibetan antelopes 

 And with your increased commitment we can battle against destructive global forces that transcend regional
 and national boundaries Overfishing deforestation climate change and the proliferation of toxic chemicals
 top the list 

 For instance our innovative  Forests for Life Campaign establishes an international network of parks and
 reserves This will protect at least of each different type of forest found in every country Another WWF
 goal  To end government subsidies that promote overfishing and to encourage new markets for sustainably managed
 fisheries 

 The challenges we face are daunting to be sure However i’m confident that by joining together again we
 can make exciting progress in the year ahead I want to ask you therefore to renew your valued World Wildlife
 Fund membership and hopefully at the Living Planet Society level of 

 When you do youll extend your commitment as an esteemed partner with WWF    the largest and most effective
 international conservation group in existence 

 Now with your increased commitment we can save more of our planets cherished wild species and their
 irreplaceable habitats as we strive to ensure a healthy and thriving future for our extraordinary natural
 world 

 Once again please accept my warmest gratitude for your past support And please take a moment today to
 renew your critically important WWF annual membership Thank you 

 Sincerely 
 Kathryn S Fuller
 President

Scene Edinburgh Trader
 a crewman swabbing the deck happens to notice a white dress tucked in a
corner pulls it out 
 the crewmen are arguing loudly about the newfound
dress 
BELLAMY Whats all this  If you both fancy the dress youll just
have to share and wear it one after the other 
BURSAR Its not like that Sir This ship is haunted 
BELLAMY Is it now  N you  
QUARTERMASTER The female presence amongst us yes all
the men they can feel it The ghost of a lady widowed before her marriage I
figure it Searching for her husband lost at sea A virgin too likely as not And
that bodes ill by all accounts 
BURSAR I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope
the spirit finds it 
QUARTERMASTER No That   that will just anger the spirit Sir 
What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs and then just get it back 
BELLAMY Enough Enough you’re a pair of superstitious goats and
its got the best of you Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway
aboard A young woman by the look of it I want you to search the ship and find
er Oh and uh she’s probably naked

bidding of Davy Jones A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your
face clean off And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness The Kraken 
 Marty turns around at mention of the word Pintel and Ragetti look at
each other 
GIBBS They say the stench of its breath is like   ooh Imagine 
The last thing you know on Gods green earth is the roar of the Kraken and the
reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses If you believe such things

Black Pearl for thirteen years That was our agreement

 terrific soprano Worth at least four maybe three and a half And did I happen
to mention he’s in love With a girl Due to be married Betrothed Dividing him
from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them

a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free

shackles 
 Mercer is looking through a mounted telescope to outside the

LORD CUTLER BECKETT Theres something to knowing the exact shape
of the world and ones place in it don’t you agree 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT I had you brought here because I thought
youd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter 
MERCER Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga then left in
the company of a known pirate Jack Sparrow And other fugitives from
justice 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Including the previous owner of this sword 
I believe Our ships are in pursuit and justice will be dispensed by cannonade and
cutlass and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal I personally find it
distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Your authority as governor your influence in
London and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company

EXT   SAMARA COSTA RICA   MIDDAY
 EXT   A BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER LANDS IN SAMARA COSTA RICA ARMORED VEHICLES ARE
HOLDING POSITIONS AROUND A RAVAGED VILLAGE   MIDDAY
 As the helicopter lands GRANT and MALCOLM debark The chopper takes
off again as a Humvee approaches them GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ exits the vehicle and
walks up to them 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ
 Shouting over the helicopter Dr Grant Dr 
Malcolm welcome to Costa Rica i’m General Sanchez and i’m in command of this
little fiasco Sorry we had to drag you here so abruptly but you know what they
say about desperate times 
ALAN GRANT Why are we here 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ We need you help Dr Grant If youll
follow me 
SANCHEZ leads GRANT and MALCOLM down to the beach 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ CONTD 
Frankly i’ve never seen anything like this Id wager no one has save you
two and a handful of others We didn’t know what to make of it at first and how
to preserve the specimen was a bit ambiguous but one of our Marines was a big
paleontology nut and had read all about you and your work and how to preserve
delicate fossils He managed to rig something up to protect the sample from the
elements until you could arrive to make the positive identification 
IAN MALCOLM So why am I here 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Youve seen firsthand how a dinosaur
behaves in an urban environment 
IAN MALCOLM If you’re talking about San Diego I can assure
you that this area is substantially different 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ What do you mean 
IAN MALCOLM What I saw was a dinosaur in a highly developed 
downtown area with nowhere to hide This is a small village with dense jungle on
all sides It might as well be back on the island 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ But you did see the dinosaurs on the
islands 
IAN MALCOLM Only the T Rexes 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ So you are uniquely familiar with the
behaviors of dinosaurs interacting with people 
IAN MALCOLM Yes but i’m sure Dr Grant is much more of an
asset than I am 
ALAN GRANT Scared Ian 
IAN MALCOLM Extremely I have been brought into a
dinosaur infested area to provide advice i’m not competent to give 
ALAN GRANT Dinosaur infested  Its only one 
IAN MALCOLM One is way too many You know that 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Regardless of your objections Dr 
Malcolm you’re here The government would’nt  have brought you into this area
unless it felt you would be an asset 
 The three of them arrive at a large tarp covered
square 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ CONTD Here we are let’s get this
thing up 
 A few Marines lift the frame up and out offscreen revealing a large
footprint 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ CONTD What do you make of that Dr 
Grant 
 GRANT stoops low and examines the trackway 
ALAN GRANT
 rising I couldnt tell you for sure 
General but it looks a bit bigger than the T Rex tracks i’ve seen Unless InGen
created another gigantic predator Id say its probably the
Spinosaur 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Okay Ill call the
Pentagon 
 SANCHEZ shouts for a soldier to set up the communications equipment to
contact the Pentagon and walks away from GRANT and MALCOLM 
IAN MALCOLM Spinosaurus 
ALAN GRANT Yeah we encountered it on Isla
Sorna 
IAN MALCOLM Odd we didn’t 
ALAN GRANT Hammond said the animals were territorial it
might be that the Spinosaur had shifted its hunting area in the years between
our little escapades 
IAN MALCOLM I didn’t read much of anything on your
misadventure on Site B 
ALAN GRANT Well the Kirbys decided to let me have the movie
rights as compensation for shall we say services rendered I was actually
working with Universal in L A when John died 
IAN MALCOLM Any reason you didn’t bring me in on
this 
ALAN GRANT God knows I tried Ian you’re a hard man to
track down Obviously the rights are as much yours as they are mine I only
accepted the offer to help fund the research were doing in Montana 
IAN MALCOLM A movie about dinosaurs  Do you think the public
will buy that 
 The conversation is interrupted by a helicopter flying low toward the
beach Several Marines shout as they hurry to cover the footprint GRANT and MALCOLM
look toward SANCHEZ who is shouting in a megaphone 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ
 through the megaphone Attention pilot this
is a no fly zone You are not authorized to land here return to your point of
origin immediately 
 The helicopter touches down on the sand and a man hops out of the rear
door He is carrying a large duffel bag and wearing khaki trousers khaki shirt and
a black ball cap The man slams the door closed pounds on it with his fist and
points skyward The chopper takes off as the man is surrounded by Marines and
Humvees 
IAN MALCOLM Who the hell is this 
ALAN GRANT Beats me Wheres General Sanchez 
IAN MALCOLM
 pointing toward the circle of Marines and the
man I think he’s going over to greet the
newcomer 
 The man is now facing away from GRANT and MALCOLM He is at gunpoint
and on his knees with his hands behind his head 
 GRANT and MALCOLM jog over to the site of the commotion The man 
CLARK who has his hands cuffed behind his back is being lead over to
SANCHEZ 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ
 shouting at CLARK Just who the hell are you
and what the hell do you think you’re doing 
JEFFERY CLARK My name is Jeffery Clark i’ve been hunting on
an island off the coast and I needed to re supply 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ didn’t your pilot hear the radio
warnings  This is a no fly zone No one gets in and no one gets out 
JEFFERY CLARK There must have been a mistake we thought
this was some sort of market 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ You cant be serious 
JEFFERY CLARK Does it really matter  i’m here now and Ill
be on my way back to the island just as soon as I buy some food 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Oh no you’re not You are under arrest
for violating a military order 
JEFFERY CLARK
 noting SANCHEZs insignia Look General do
you really have the facilities to hold me 
IAN MALCOLM Excuse me General Sanchez Mr Clark was it 
What island were you hunting on 
JEFFERY CLARK Well since it looks like i’m already in
trouble it cant hurt to tell you I was on Isla Sorna 
IAN MALCOLM You were hunting dinosaurs 
JEFFERY CLARK
 sarcastically No Isla Sorna is well known
for its penguin population 
JEFFERY CLARK CONTD recognizing MALCOLM 
Wait are you Ian Malcolm 
IAN MALCOLM Yes Do I know you 
JEFFERY CLARK No you knew my uncle Roland
Tembo 
IAN MALCOLM I would’nt  say I knew him that well How is he
doing by the way 
JEFFERY CLARK Not well i’m afraid that’s the only reason
Im here and he’s not 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Enough Mr Clark you have just
stumbled into a very dangerous area As much as I hate it you are stuck here
until the beast is captured 
JEFFERY CLARK Beast  What beast 
ALAN GRANT The Spinosaur 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ
 snapping at GRANT Dr Grant 
JEFFERY CLARK What about the rexes 
ALAN GRANT What about the rexes 
JEFFERY CLARK They werent on the island either 
IAN MALCOLM How many T Rexes are we talking about here  As
far as I knew there were only three Two adults and the baby 
ALAN GRANT Right and one of them was killed by the
Spinosaur while I was on the island 
JEFFERY CLARK So there might be two more dinosaurs on the
mainland 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Gentlemen We cant just jump to that
conclusion 
IAN MALCOLM he’s right There could be a thousand reasons
you didn’t see the T Rexes on the island Maybe the Spinosaur killed the other
two in the interim since he killed the first one maybe they swam for it and
drowned The fact is we don’t know and we shouldnt draw conclusions that
might further disturb the public 
CPL RICK TOWNSEND
 Running toward SANCHEZ General Sanchez sir 
News from Nosara 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ What is it  An attack 
CPL RICK TOWNSEND No Sir another footprint has been
found 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Same print 
CPL RICK TOWNSEND No Sir Its smaller Sir 
JEFFERY CLARK What are the chances the spinos feet
shrunk 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Shut up Mr Clark Dr Grant could
the tracks have been made by the same animal 
ALAN GRANT Its possible where is Nosra 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Corporal 
CPL RICK TOWNSEND Nosara Sir Its about fifteen or twenty
kilometers up the coast 
ALAN GRANT I imagine its technically possible A T Rex
moving at full speed was clocked at thirty some miles per hour The Spinosaur
had a slightly longer gait so Id put its normal walking speed at about ten 
maybe fifteen miles per hour 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Right and that would put him there
within an hour of leaving here and it was last seen almost six hours ago It
had plenty of time to get up there 
CPL RICK TOWNSEND Sir we have reason to believe the tracks
were made less than an hour ago Given the prints position and the receeding
tide it couldnt have been made more than forty five minutes ago 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Jesus forty five minutes
ago 
CPL RICK TOWNSEND Well fifty minutes now Sir 
ALAN GRANT And whats the size difference 
CPL RICK TOWNSEND Twelve inches Sir 
ALAN GRANT General Sanchez I think we have to consider the
possibility that there is a second dinosaur in Costa Rica 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ
 thinking then sighing Corporal get on the
horn notify all units of the second dinosaur 
CPL RICK TOWNSEND Yes Sir 
TOWNSEND leaves
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ You three stay here i’m going to call
Washington and break the news to them 
JEFFERY CLARK
 motioning to his hands General would you
mind 
SANCHEZ motions for a Marine to unlock CLARKs hands 
JEFFERY CLARK CONTD What about my bag 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Its still being searched Youll get
it back when were satisfied that you’re no longer a threat In the mean time 
stay put 
SANCHEZ walks off toward a communications tent 
GRANTs phone rings Its SATTLER calling from Seattle The shot cuts
between each speaker as they talk > ALAN
GRANT Alan Grant 
ELLIE SATTLER Alan its Ellie 
ALAN GRANT Oh Ellie How are you doing  What have you found
out 
ELLIE SATTLER I found Dr Wang He was less than willing to
be helpful but I managed to glean a few things 
ALAN GRANT About the Spinosaur what about the
Spinosaur 
ELLIE SATTLER As it turns out the spino was one of the
first dinosaurs bred on the island Apparantly there was a mix up in the lab
and they cloned a Spinosaur instead of a Tyrannosaur 
ALAN GRANT Great how does that help us 
ELLIE SATTLER It gets worse actually The spino and the
rexes were both prototypes for the lysine contingency but the system wasnt
perfected until the next set of dinosaurs were cloned 
ALAN GRANT Ellie what are you saying 
ELLIE SATTLER Alan the spino and the rexes don’t need
supplemental enzymes to survive They can make their own lysine 
ALAN GRANT Then how can we stop them 
ELLIE SATTLER I don’t know but please be
careful 
ALAN GRANT Thanks Ellie I will 
 GRANT walks back toward SANCHEZ MALCOLM and CLARK 
IAN MALCOLM Dr Sattler 
ALAN GRANT Yes 
IAN MALCOLM What did she find out 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ
 walking back from the tent Whos Dr 
Sattler 
ALAN GRANT She located the head researcher at of Site B He
told her that the Spinosaur and the T Rexes were not bred
lysine deficient 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ And that means what to us
exacty 
ALAN GRANT It means the animals can exist indefinitly eating
non lysine enriched food 
IAN MALCOLM You mean whatever they can find 
ALAN GRANT i’m afraid so 
JEFFERY CLARK General I came down here to hunt the T Rex 
and I will do so if you let me 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Mr Clark I cant in good conscience
let a civillian go on his own when there are not one but two dangerous
creatures still running amok Even if there werent dinosaurs in this are I
wouldnt let you leave with enough firepower to engage a small armored
division 
JEFFERY CLARK Are you talking about my uncles elephant gun
or my rifle 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Jesus Clark its a fifty caliber
anti material rifle not your everyday deer gun 
JEFFERY CLARK i’m hunting something a little bigger than a
deer I can tell you that 
ALAN GRANT Wait a minute We still don’t know why the
Spinosaur came here but if the relationship between the two species is the
same we can assume why the T Rex came too 
IAN MALCOLM You think the rex is chasing the
Spinosaur 
ALAN GRANT I read Sarah Hardings book about the parenting
instincts of the T Rexes If they destroyed your trailers because you took their
infant imagine what theyd have done if you had killed it 
IAN MALCOLM So the Spinosaur kills the baby rex and mom goes
out looking for revenge  How would it have even tracked it 
ALAN GRANT By smell The T Rex was only a few hours behind
the Spinosaur They could very easily have left at nearly the same
time 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ The question still remains how do we
find them  I think its pretty clear that we seal off Costa Ricas borders If
either one of them gets south of Panama well never find them in the
Amazon 
IAN MALCOLM Considering General that these animals swam
two hundred miles to get here I think its safe to say they could swim from
here to South America without much difficulty 
ALAN GRANT We need to find one of them If we find the
T Rex it will lead us to the Spinosaur If we find the Spinosaur the T rex
will come to us First well have to figure out a more secure method for
containing them Clearly an ocean is no obstacle 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Dr Grant the official position is to
neutralize the threat as quickly as possible 
ALAN GRANT What are you talking
about  neutralize  
IAN MALCOLM Alan these dinosaurs cant be contained 
Theyve overcome every security obstacle people have put in their way If we
build a better cage they are just going to break out again and
again 
ALAN GRANT You know my dislike of John Hammond was just as
strong as yours but he was right Ian We are the only people who can protect
the animals and the island Their creation may have been illegitimatized in a
lab but their lives are real 
IAN MALCOLM How many disasters will it take Alan  How many
people have to end up as dinner for these dinosaurs before they become
nuisances  When the good of the world is on the line we have to sacrifice the
good of our charges 
ALAN GRANT How do we do that  Punish them for evolving  If
people didn’t have a right to play God by creating them we certainly don’t have
a right to play God by causing another extinction 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Gentlemen if you please We don’t have
time for a philosophical debate here If we can contain the animals well give
it a try but my orders are to stabilize the area using any and all means
necessary 
ALAN GRANT Fine 
IAN MALCOLM Dr Grant was right about how to find them If
we can follow the rex hell lead us right to the Spinosaurus but it will be
hard to remain inconspicuous if we follow him with an army I suggest that we
send one person to track him 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Any suggestions as to who the one
person might be 
IAN MALCOLM
 indicating CLARK The person who has been out
to get the rex from day one 
JEFFERY CLARK Me 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Him 
IAN MALCOLM If he’s half the hunter his uncle is then he
should have no problem Do you feel up to it 
JEFFERY CLARK Of course I am provided I get my things
back 
GEN HORATIO SANCHEZ Well see about that 
JEFFERY CLARK Also provided that I am the one who takes the
Tyrannosaur

Isla Sorna day fourteen I have been on this island for two weeks and Ive
seen no sign of either the T Rex or the Spinosaurus I have been to all of the

LEATHER CHAIR   MORNING 

IAN MALCOLM
 Actually the San Diego incident restored a lot of my credibility I was no
longer a lunatic who had seen dinosaurs with a bunch of other people who didn’t 



ALAN GRANT
About that 


ELLIE SATTLER
Were really sorry we didn’t back you up about the park 


ALAN GRANT
There was just so much at stake research money had been really hard to come
by In retrospect it wasn’t worth lying 


ELLIE SATTLER
You lost as much as we did on that island we shouldnt have deserted you 



ALAN GRANT
Im sorry Ian 


IAN MALCOLM
I have to admit I did hold it against you in the beginning but now I look
back and I realize that three lunatics would have been no more convincing to the
general public than just one 


ELLIE SATTLER
Are you forgiving us  


IAN MALCOLM
 smirking 
Well I don’t usually let people slide for mistakes of this magnitude but
what the heck Its water under the bridge 

 PERKINS enters from behind GRANT MALCOLM and SATTLER He is carrying
a large manila envelope 

SAMUEL PERKINS
 moving from the door to his desk 
Sorry to have kept you waiting for so long I know we all have business to
tend to today so Ill be as brief as possible 

PERKINS reads off of the envelope 

SAMUEL PERKINS CONTD 
I Jonathon Parker Hammond as my final wish request that the following video
be shown only to Alan Grant Ellen Sattler and Ian Malcolm and only to the
three of the aforementioned as a group of three on the occasion of my death  



IAN MALCOLM
Just your average  farewell from beyond the grave  boilerplate huh  


SAMUEL PERKINS
 laughing 
Mr Hammond hated lawyers almost as much as he hated the language we use 



SAMUEL PERKINS CONTD 
 indicating the VHS tape 
But I think this should be quite straightforward Mr Hammond always seemed
like that kind of man to me 


ALAN GRANT
 Searching for the word 
He was 


ELLIE SATTLER
Unique 


IAN MALCOLM
To put it mildly 


SAMUEL PERKINS
 turning on the TV 
Okay i’m just going to go ahead and start this tape 

 When PERKINS turns on the TV CNN shows on the screen with one of their
regular programs When he pushes  play  the screen goes black for a moment then
John Hammond fades into view He is dressed in a robe and is clearly reclining in a
hospital bed with I V bags hanging near him and a heart monitor at his side 

JOHN HAMMOND
Gday I suppose that if you’re watching this the inevitable has already
occurred I have passed from this life to what I hope will be a merciful
afterlife 


JOHN HAMMOND CONTD 
I want to take a moment to apologize once more to each of you for the
tremendous pain and hardships I put you through Dr Sattler I hope you can
find it in your heart to forgive me for what happened in the park I know the
years that followed the disaster werent easy on you or your relationship with
Dr Grant Dr Grant I want to apologize to you for burdening you with the
safety of what amounted to three children on two separate islands I know that
the revelation of Site B has had a negative impact on your research in Montana 
I hope you find a way to continue your excellent work in the field Dr Malcolm 
you put yourself in harms way twice at my request I had no intention of ever
hurting anyone but misfortune seemed to be the norm on the islands 


JOHN HAMMOND CONTD 
Id also like to thank the three of you I thank Dr Sattler for teaching me
humility Before the disaster on Isla Nublar I thought of myself as the creator
of a perfect system a god of the island itself As it turns out I was only
playing God as Ian pointed out so well Thank you Ian for teaching me that
there are some things Man cannot control Dr Grant I want to thank you again
for taking care of my grandchildren in the park What you did for them and then
what you did for that family on Isla Sorna are truly worthy of the highest
praise 


JOHN HAMMOND CONTD 
Finally I must ask the three of you for something I have long considered
myself the steward of the islands and their inhabitants but I will not be here
forever When I am gone they will need someone to be their caretakers their
advocates and their guardians I am asking the three of you to take up my
cause i’m not asking you because I feel you owe me anything quite the
opposite I am asking you to take this responsibility because you are the only
three people in the world I know I can trust to make the right decisions 



JOHN HAMMOND CONTD 
Before I leave you Id like to let you know i’ve done everything in my power
to provide for the welfare and well being of the families of those souls lost on
the islands i’ve also set up a trust fund for the defense of the islands Mr 
Perkins will be able to provide you with all the necessary paperwork and Ive
retained him as chief counsel for you Any other information you could need lies
in the mind of Dr Garret Wang He was my head engineer at Site B After the
facility was cleared out Dr Wang went to work for a firm in
Seattle GenetiCorp 


JOHN HAMMOND CONTD 
Id like to say i’m sorry one more time and ask you to consider what Ive
asked of you if not for me then for the animals themselves God bless you and
good luck 

 The TV screen fades to black and then goes to static PERKINS pops the
tape out and CNN rolls muted in the background 

SAMUEL PERKINS
 Turning to face GRANT SATTLER and MALCOLM 
Like Mr Hammond said I have all of the papers for the Dinosaur Defense Fund
right here 


ALAN GRANT
 Looking over PERKINS shoulder at the TV screen 
What the hell is that  

 All four people move closer to the TV as PERKINS turns the sound on 
CNN has a live  breaking news  story datelined in Costa Rica The video camera pans
between the reporter and a large footprint in the wet beach sand 

MELINA ORTEGA O S 
 As you can see by the size of this impression this is a very large
creature Witnesses estimate its length at about forty of fifty feet with
gigantic tooth filled jaws 


FRANTIC WITNESS
 in broken English 
The thing was laying on the beach when I woke up this morning One of the dogs
from the neighborhood ran up to it and started barking The lizard woke up and
made a horrible noise The whole village shook 


MELINA ORTEGA
Apparently the creatures roar brought many curious villagers out of their
homes When it caught sight of them it attacked Casualty reports range
anywhere from a half dozen to twenty or more 


MELINA ORTEGA CONTD 
 Motioning for the camera to point toward military vehicles in the
background 
As you can see behind me the U S Marines have already arrived Apparently
they were engaging in training maneuvers near the Panama Canal when word of this
broke While it is not clear what the strategy here will be it is clear that
they are not underestimating the threat 

Camera focuses on a tank 

ELLIE SATTLER
My god Theyre on the mainland 


ALAN GRANT
Oh no 


IAN MALCOLM
Damn it John you knew this could happen 

 Scene cuts back to the TV screen 

MELINA ORTEGA
 walking swiftly toward a group of armored
vehicles 
Were being told to clear the area so were heading into an area the Marines
have rendered safe We wont be able to broadcast a live feed from the area so
until were clear this is Melina Ortega live in Costa Rica 


CNN ANCHOR
Our thoughts and prayers for a safe return are with you Melina Right now we
have just received amateur footage of the attack and were going to roll that
for you now 

 A grainy video recorded at early dawn shows a two legged dinosaur
tearing open a car and disappearing into the jungle 

CNN ANCHOR CONTD O S 
Again this was taken by an amateur cameraman in Costa Rica sometime in the
pre dawn hours of this morning The picture quality isn’t good but you can
clearly see what can only be described as a dinosaur attacking a car 

TV cuts back to the ANCHORMAN 

CNN ANCHOR CONTD 
Of course we havent seen anything like this since the incident in San
Diego when a Tyrannosaurus Rex created by InGen got loose and went on a rampage
through the city 


IAN MALCOLM
Is this really happening  

 GRANT SATTLER and PERKINS are all glued to the TV when there is a
knock at the door 

SAMUEL PERKINS
 not really paying attention 
Come 

A young Army officer steps into the office 

LT AMY BRANNIGAN
 Sorry to bother you sir I was sent for Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ian Malcolm 



ALAN GRANT
Thats us What do you need  


LT AMY BRANNIGAN
You gentlemen need to come with me 


IAN MALCOLM
What  Why

ALAN GRANT
Look Miss 


LT AMY BRANNIGAN
Its Lieutenant Lieutenant Brannigan 


ALAN GRANT
Of course i’m sorry Its just that a lot has happened in such a short time 
and I think were all just going to need a little time to put it all together 



LT AMY BRANNIGAN
Sir I know you might feel that way right now but I have been ordered to
bring you with me without delay 


IAN MALCOLM
Im afraid I have to agree with Dr Grant here Lieutenant 


LT AMY BRANNIGAN
Sir there are two Military Police officer waiting in the hall and two more
outside i’m to place you under arrest if you don’t come with me right now 



ALAN GRANT
Well Ian it looks like wed better go 


ALAN GRANT CONTD 
 whispering to SATTLER 
Ellie go to Seattle and find Dr Wang We need to know everything we can
about whatever this thing is 


ELLIE SATTLER
You think this has something to do with the incident in Costa Rica

Id bet my bottom dollar 








EXT   CEMETERY   DAY 
 EXT   A LIGHT RAIN IS FALLING ON A CEMETERY IN CALIFORNIA   DAY 
 Start with a wide shot of the cemetery Follow a single 
umbrella carrying individual up the hill to join the funeral under an awning We
cant see his face but he makes his way over to two other individuals standing
apart from the main group who we only see from the back The man closes and shakes

that your passing adds a sense of closure to twelve years of horror Ah thats

SENATE ETHICS PANEL ADMONISHES NEW JERSEY SENATOR FOR CONDUCT RELATED TO
GIFTS

WASHINGTON
The Senate Ethics Committee on Tuesday night  severely admonished  Sen Robert G Torricelli 
D N J saying he had violated Senate rules by accepting and failing to disclose expensive gifts
from a former contributor to whom he repeatedly gave help 
On the basis of thousands of pages of information developed in an earlier federal inquiry
into Torricellis activities the committee chastised him for using poor judgment and
disregarding Senate rules in his dealings with the former donor David Chang 
 Your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules and related statutes and
created at least the appearance of impropriety   the three Democrats and three Republicans on
the committee said in a three page letter to Torricelli 
The ethics panel also ordered Torricelli to pay back Chang    with interest    for the full
value of a large screen television set and compact disc player and for expensive earrings that
Chang gave to Torricellis sister to one of his close aides and to one of Torricellis former
girlfriends 
The committees action comes six months after federal prosecutors ended a lengthy criminal
investigation into Torricellis activities without filing criminal charges 
The ethics panel to which evidence from the criminal case was forwarded concluded its review
just as Torricelli is gearing up his campaign for re election against the Republican candidate 
Douglas R Forrester After months in which polls showed Torricelli well ahead of his relatively
unknown Republican rival the contest has narrowed in recent weeks 
It was the first time that the Senate Ethics Committee had voted to take action against a
senator since when it recommended that Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican be expelled on
the ground of sexual and official misconduct Packwood later resigned 
Sen Daniel K Inouye D Hawaii who led the ethics inquiry said he believed the
investigation was thorough and fair but would not offer a detailed description of the
committees secret deliberations  The document speaks for itself   said Inouye who said that
he considered the matter closed with the letter 
Within minutes after the committee released its letter publicly Torricelli took the Senate
floor Tuesday night to apologize to the people of New Jersey for allowing his seat in the
chamber  to be placed in this position  
During nearly seven hours of sworn testimony last week before the members and staff of the
ethics panel Torricelli said that he had not taken any gifts from Chang and that what items he
had accepted from the businessman he had later paid Chang for one person familiar with his
account said 
Torricelli also insisted that he had not done any unusual favors for Chang who first turned
to the senator in for help in winning the repayment of some million he said he was then
owed in a failed business deal with the North Korean government 
The Ethics Committee was unconvinced 
In its letter which was signed by all six members the panel wrote that it was  troubled by
incongruities inconsistencies and conflicts particularly concerning actions taken by you which
were or could have been of potential benefit to Chang  
The committee criticized Torricelli for maintaining a  personal and official relationship with
Chang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself in part
through a pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of
several years  
During that time the panel said Torricelli and members of his Senate staff took a series of
actions to help Chang contacting U S government officials writing letters to foreign
government officials and bringing Chang or his business representatives into meetings with
foreign officials 
The committee did not confirm some of the most serious allegations including Changs claim
that he gave Torricelli tens of thousands of dollars in cash 
The committee said it had weighed the fact that Torricellis principal accuser in the case had
been Chang  a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the Department of
Justice a United States District judge and his own conduct   In May that judge sentenced
sentenced Chang to months imprisonment for obstructing justice and making in illegal
campaign contributions to Torricellis Senate campaign 
But at the time of Changs sentencing the judge Alfred M Wolin also said the businessman
had cooperated closely with federal investigators providing them with information that was
 material and credible  
The ethics committee has the power to punish lawmakers with sanctions ranging from public or
private letters of admonition to censure or expulsion In Torricellis case it acted without
conducting a full investigation saying the case had been exhaustively scrutinized by federal
authorities 
A lawyer for Chang Bradley D Simon said Tuesday night that he was disappointed that the
ethics panel had confirmed only a handful of the gifts he said his client had given Torricelli 
and that the panel did not deal with what he said were actions by Torricelli to thwart the
federal investigation 
 This matter was far more serious than what the committee found   Simon said 
According to two government officials involved in the inquiry the Ethics Committee received a
vast amount of information from federal investigators some of it under a court order issued in
March 
That information included witness statements store receipts and other documents indicating
that Chang had paid for expensive items given to Torricelli his sister one of his longtime
aides Roberta Stern and one of Torricellis former girlfriends Judy D Balaban 
The committees letter did not mention Changs reported gifts to Torricelli of an Rolex
watch about a dozen Italian made suits and a antique grandfather clock Nor did it cite
a Oriental carpet that Chang gave to Torricellis former wife Susan Holloway Torricelli 
A government official involved in the inquiry said that evidence of those gifts was either
incomplete or the subject of conflicting accounts by different witnesses 
The committee confirmed Torricellis claims he had made partial repayments to Chang for two
gifts a large screen television and a stereo compact disc player But it said the senator had
showed  poor judgment  by failing to reimburse him for the full market value of the gifts 
A person familiar with Torricellis testimony to the committee said he had told its members
that he repaid the  wholesale  cost of the appliances because Chang told him that was what he
had paid 
The ethics panel also criticized Torricelli for taking two bronze statues on loan from Chang 
The statues the existence of which had not been publicly known before were displayed in
Torricellis Senate office 
Finally the committee appeared to have discounted Torricellis contention that he was not
responsible for expensive earrings that Chang had given as Christmas gifts to his sister Stern
and Balaban The senators belief  that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you
under the circumstances  displayed poor judgment and violated Senate gift rules the panel
found 
According to a government official involved in the inquiry the information reviewed by the
Ethics Committee also included an analysis by federal investigators showing that during the
period in which Chang claimed to have made numerous cash payments to Torricelli the senator
spent thousands of dollars more in cash than investigators could account for from his bank
withdrawals and other known sources of income 
The analysis which was assembled from banking and credit records income tax returns and
congressional financial disclosure forms showed by March of Torricellis cash
expenditures were more than in excess of the cash he had generated from checks and
automatic teller machines an official who has reviewed the document said 
A spokeswoman for Torricelli Debra DeShong said he had fully accounted for all the money he
had spent 
 Senator Torricelli provided the committee with a full explanation of sources of income and
any funds used for cash purposes   she said 
Even after the ethics committee admonished Torricelli on Tuesday night one of his most
important political supporters Senate majority leader Tom Daschle D S D continued to defend
him stating that the panel had found Chang  a witness wholly without credibility  
Moving quickly to make a campaign issue of the Senate letter Bill Pascoe Forresters
campaign manager said the findings were evidence that Torricelli had undertaken an  extensive
campaign of misinformation and deceit   and called on him to release the sworn testimony he gave
to the panel 
Pascoe said  Only then will New Jersey voters be able to decide Torricellis fitness for
office  



POWELL IN BRUNEI FOR TERROR TALKS BUT HUMAN RIGHTS REMAINS PERSISTENT
ISSUE
BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN Brunei
U S Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow
foreign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front in Southeast Asia in the campaign
against global terrorism But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about
human rights abuses in the region 
In meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil producing
sultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations 
Powell said he repeatedly raised the issue  We still believe strongly in human rights and that
everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights   he said 
But at a news conference in Singapore Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to
discuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia the worlds most populous Muslim nation
and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups The
United States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in after its forces were
implicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for
independence 
On Thursday Powell and representatives of the nations of the Asian group including
Indonesia are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by
sharing information blocking funds tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel
papers 
 We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and
transnational crimes which continue to threaten world peace and stability must be tackled by
the international community   the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday 
Powell is among the representatives from nations outside Southeast Asia including China 
Japan and Russia that are taking part in the annual meeting of the groups regional forum 
Terrorism dominates the agenda though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and
his North Korean counterpart Paek Nam Sun has generated the most news It would be the
highest level contact between the United States and North Korea since President Bush took
office 
Powell heads to Indonesias capital Jakarta late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong
trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday He said that when he arrives in Jakarta 
he will have  some ideas and some initiatives  to present to President Megawati
Sukarnoputri 
Indonesia is already receiving in the current fiscal year for civilian training
programs and is to receive a like amount next year and the United States expects to provide an
additional million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism At the same time 
the Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another million in  counterterrorism fellowships  
some of which could go to Indonesia 
But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and
Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation which would require congressional
approval 
 I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating
more fully with us as time goes by and i’m quite sure that Mrs Megawati is committed to this
cause   Powell said in Singapore He met there with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong who endorsed
the idea of renewed military ties between the United States and Indonesia as an important step
in stabilizing that country 
Powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an
organization like the Indonesian military which has a history of human rights abuses  If you
get young officers expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political
institution such as the United States then that rubs off on them   he said 
In Malaysia Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad who has led the country since
 The Malaysian foreign minister Syed Hamid Albar later told local reporters that Powell
had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional
training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities 
His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent
terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often
criticized 
The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong arm tactics with political
rivals and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected
militants including some who may be linked to al Qaida without trial 
Powell said his discussions with Mahathir  touched on the case  of his former deputy Anwar
Ibrahim who is serving a  year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials
that Powell said the United States had  always felt  were flawed 
The assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs James Kelly met on
Tuesday morning with Anwars wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail for what she later told Malaysian
reporters was a discussion about both the detention of her husband and six supporters and the
campaign against terrorism 
MICROSOFT TEAMS WITH AT T TO OFFER SOFTWARE FOR WIRELESS DEVICES AND
SERVICES
Microsoft plans to announce on Wednesday a partnership with AT T Wireless Services to
offer software for wireless devices and services a person close to the talks said Tuesday
night 
The deal would be part of Microsofts drive to sign up wireless carriers to use its so called
smart phone software    a pared down version of the Windows operating system    and services
that Microsoft is developing as part of its Net Internet strategy 
Neither Microsoft nor AT T Wireless would comment 
The main market for the Microsoft AT T partnership is expected to be business customers 
Microsofts efforts to persuade wireless carriers to use its cell phone operating system have
struggled It has run into particular opposition from companies aligned with Nokia which has
developed a competing software 
But Microsofts potential advantage analysts say is its ability to link its cell phone
software to its desktop PC software a Microsoft stronghold Customers who want access to
Microsoft desktop e mail documents and calendar information may prefer Microsofts wireless
technology 
In recent months Microsoft has announced partnerships with wireless carriers like Verizon and
Sprint PCS 
MONTREAL TRADES FLOYD TO RED SOX FOR TWO PITCHERS
Less than three weeks after outfielder Cliff Floyd was imported to Montreal to play a pivotal
part in the Expos playoff plans he was traded to Boston Tuesday night to try his hand in what
the Red Sox hope will be their postseason plans 
Floyd did not produce the kind of offense the Expos expected from him so Omar Minaya the
Expos aggressive rookie general manager turned around and sent him to the Red Sox in exchange
two South Korean pitchers and a player yet to be named 
The teams made the deal less than hours before Tuesdays p m deadline for making trades
without first getting waivers on players Minaya obtained Floyd from the Florida Marlins on July
 only two weeks after he stunned baseball by acquiring Bartolo Colon from Cleveland 
Colon has won four of five decisions for the Expos but Floyd batted only for them while
hitting three home runs including one Tuesday night and driving in four runs With the Marlins
Floyd bated hit home runs and drove in runs 
The Expos who had a   record when they made their first Floyd deal had only a   
record with him on the team dropping from   games behind Atlanta in the National League
East to as many as games back 
Floyd can be a free agent after this season and Minaya decided it would be more prudent to
trade him and get value in return than have to settle for a draft choice or two as compensation
when he signed with another team as a free agent 
The Expos acquired Sun Woo kim and Seung Jun song Kim is a right handed pitcher from
Seoul The Red Sox signed him in Song is a  year old right hander from Pusan The Red
Sox signed him in 
The Red Sox wanted to bolster their offense They led the Yankees for most of the first three
months of the season but then slipped behind them in the American League East 
Earlier in the day Tuesday one member of the Red Sox organization was not sure they would be
able to get Floyd  I don’t know that he’s that serious about moving him   the person said of
Minaya 
But as the day wore on the Red Sox tried harder and by Tuesday night were able to get the
player they wanted for their lineup 



EX HOG OFFERS JUMP START AND HELPS CHANGE LIVES
WASHINGTON
With the barrage of crack cocaine connected killings in the s came the realization that
young people were too often full fledged players in the violence 
That was more evident here than in any other city said George Starke who after his career as
an offensive tackle with the Washington Redskins from to stuck around and decided to
make this place more than his home 
 There was death in D C throughout the s and into the s and there was death
everywhere   said Starke who was reared in New Rochelle N Y and played at Columbia  It
wasnt like New Yorks or Bostons organized crime It was kids shooting kids It was a
  year old from R Street who got his crew of six together and ran their drug block killing
another  year old and his crew from a block away And from the beginning I could see that it
was all about jobs I could see that you needed the private sector involved  
Starke could see that in many instances these were cases of lost dignity  I had a young man
come up to me three years ago and say Mr Starke i’m tired of going to bed at night with a
Tech  gun under my pillow  
And Starke was tired of seeing Washington and its young people suffer a black eye 
So after six years of planning he opened the Excel Institute Automotive Program a two year
school that gives people a chance at a new life as an auto technician or in another job related
to the field The school now in its third year has been so successful that it recently
received a million grant from Congress The program is being copied by other cities and has
attracted students from all walks of life ages to 
The program is coordinated with the University of the District of Columbia Students learn
automotive intricacies and can earn a a high school equivalency diploma Thanks to Starkes
vision leadership and fund raising they can do it all free 
Starke played in two Super Bowls and won one He played for George Allen Jack Pardee and
Joe Gibbs In he was young enough to be a part of the Redskins Over the Hill Gang and in
 he was old enough to be one of the teams original Hogs He was recently named one of the
 greatest Redskins He earned a physics degree from Columbia became a Redskin studied drama 
worked in sports broadcasting opened a Washington restaurant and built his own home here when
he thought he might become a developer  just so I could know how the business worked from the
ground up   he said In he bought a Ford dealership In he sold it to begin work on
the Excel Institute putting up to get things started 
 I saw a lot of kids and young men out there with no dads and no structure who couldnt read
and some of them were beginning to realize that there is no growing old as a crack dealer    you
either die or go to jail   he said  My experience in the automotive industry was there was a
dire shortage of auto technicians not only in America but internationally  
So Starke matched a problem with a problem and found a solution 
The institute has a full time staff of Twelve of those are teachers Seventy students are
participating in summer classes Forty new students are expected for fall classes and there is a
waiting list of at least that many Starke said 
Angela Nafis of Ecuador has been in the school for a year She learned to speak English 
got a drivers license and earned her GED 
Charles Easterling said he had been enrolled for a month but lived  wherever  
 Im homeless now trying to find a place to lay my head   he said 
Starke said the school was helping Easterling find housing Easterling said he would do
whatever it took to become stable 
John Orellana just got a technicians job at a Jiffy Lube last week Not bad for a guy
who was kicked out of high school in for threatening a teacher 
 I did a lot of walking got an interview and got a job and an opportunity of a lifetime  
Orellana said  It shows if you have the will and the dedication here you can learn a lot and be
something It taught me maturity This school is like a big family  
Edward Jewell retired from his job as a copyright assistant at the Library of Congress in
  Ive been flapping my wings since until I found this school   he said  I needed a new
skill This has been invaluable enriching I get up and come down here at a m every day full
of joy and energized i’m grateful to George Starke to have had the vision to set something like
this up not just for me but for all the students George is doing what he’s supposed to be
doing because God is blessing him and he’s sure blessing me And when I become a technician I
will help the poor and needy by giving them affordable rates  
Starke said the school would move to a building near the citys bus depot in the fall The
city has talked with Starke about using his students for some vehicle repairs He is proud of
the red Cobra that sits in the schools workshop It was rebuilt from shell to finish by his
first class and was included in the districts millennium celebrations 
His current class is rebuilding a black one This one will be auctioned for the school 
 I just wanted to be a part   said Starke who is certain he is the lone Redskin past or
present who lives in the city He has lived here for years  A lot of kids are afraid of
the process and I wanted to take the process out For this school once they are in all
they have to do is come every day come on time every day and work hard A little more than 
percent of our kids make it through I want it to be more but my job is not to see that
everybody makes it my job is to see that everybody has the opportunity to make it  



 RARE COIN FETCHES RECORD MILLION AT AUCTION 
NEW YORK
The double eagle a gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president a
king and a Secret Service sting operation was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price
for a coin million nearly double the previous record 
The anonymous buyer believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States 
made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine minute auction at Sothebys in Manhattan 
Eight bidders were joined by coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience
seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders while an additional observers followed the bidding on
eBay 
As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy the sale price
 suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong   said David Redden a
vice chairman at Sothebys who was the auctioneer 
 This is an astonishing new record for a coin   he said 
In an unprecedented move the auction proceeds were split by the U S Mint and a London coin
dealer Stephen Fenton who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret
Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in
 
Henrietta Holsman Fore the director of the U S Mint who witnessed the sale said  The
monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on
terrorism  
Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on  a long historic journey with a very
satisfying ending  
He added  I am thrilled with the price   The previous numismatic record holder was an 
U S silver dollar which sold for million in 
Sothebys partner in the one lot auction was Stacks Rare Coins with which it shared the
customary percent commission  I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in
my years in the business   said Lawrence R Stack the companys managing director 
 This is the Mona Lisa of coins   said Beth Deisher editor of Coin World the largest weekly
coin publication in the United States with a circulation of  It is unique Forbidden
fruit  
Collectors Web sites have surged with speculation about the sale price and enthusiasts even
organized betting pools 
On Tuesday night Redden took the podium for nine minutes before the gavel came down 
recognizing bidders in the audience and on the telephone The tension in the crowd was broken
with a burst of applause after the million mark and a louder explosion at million 
The rumor in the crowd had been that  anything under million would be a bargain   said Ute
Wartenberg executive director of the American Numismatic Society in Manhattan Most bidders
dropped out after that price The gavel sounded at million after a Sothebys senior vice
president Selby Kiffer made the final bid for the anonymous buyer on the telephone The sale
price of million when added to the commission totaled million 
The auction attendance was swelled by coin collectors who had gathered on the eve of the
American Numismatic Association Convention the largest coin show of the year expected to draw
more than people to the Marriott Marquis Hotel Wednesday  So the auction was almost like
the ribbon cutting ceremony for the convention   Stack said 
Fore of the mint said the high price for the coin was reached  because it is one of a kind it
is beautiful and it has a great story  
The coin was the only double eagle that has ever been legally offered for sale and its
Maltese Falconesque history only recently came to light thanks to documents unearthed during
the five year legal battle over its ownership 
In it was deemed that all gold and silver U S coins would bear the depiction of an
eagle but gold pieces were issued only after a gold rush boom in They were called double
eagles because their face value was twice that of the original gold piece 
Following the suggestion of President Theodore Roosevelt the sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens
redesigned the coin in in high relief forever after giving the coins the designation
 saints  
But in President Franklin D Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard and
ordered all the saints already manufactured destroyed save for two reserved for the
Smithsonian Institution They were never declared legal currency 
Presumably after being stolen by a mint employee nine double eagles surfaced during the
mid  s and s They were seized by the Secret Service and melted down But before these
coins came to light the royal legation of Egypt turned up with one at the Department of the
Treasury and somehow got an official to issue an export license for the coin to enhance the
collection of King Farouk By the time that blunder was discovered the coin had left the United
States 
In after the king was deposed his coins were sold at auction and the double eagle
vanished It went underground until it came to Fenton in His arrest in Manhattan after
attempting to sell the coin for million led to a court battle over whether    thanks to
the Treasurys mistaken export permission in    the coin could be legally owned 
The double eagle came close to being melted down many times The coin once again escaped
destruction when it was moved from the Treasury Department vault in World Trade Center eight
months before the building collapsed after the Sept terrorist attack 
The record price was seen as a gift by coin collectors  Many people believe that our great
coin rarities are vastly undervalued in comparison to old master paintings   Deisher said 
In a ceremony after the sale Fore of the mint declared the coin the only double eagle
ever to be legally issued by the U S government This  monetized  the coin making it legal
tender The buyer will receive a certificate of transfer stating just that but only after
paying the auction price and a fee of for the face value of the coin 



ETHICS COMMITTEE CITES TORRICELLIS POOR JUDGMENT
Following are excerpts from the findings of the Senate Ethics Committees report on Sen 
Robert G Torricellis dealings with David Chang 
 Your acceptance of a television and stereo CD player upon payment from David Chang of an
amount you understood to be the cost to Mr Chang rather than fair market retail value 
evidenced poor judgment displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a
violation of the Senate Gifts Rules and consequently a violation of your public
disclosure obligations under Senate rules 
 Your acceptance on loan from Mr Chang of bronze statues eagle and bronco buster for
display in your Senate office under your offices policy of accepting the loan of home state
artwork was not consistent with Senate rules governing such loans evidenced poor judgment 
displayed a lack of due regard for the Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate
Gifts Rule and consequently a violation of your public disclosure obligations under
Senate rules 
 Your failure to act to prevent the acceptance of or to pay for gifts of earrings from Mr 
Chang to individuals your sister an employee and a friend in your home at Christmas on the
mistaken belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the
circumstances evidenced poor judgment displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and
resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule and consequently a violation of your
public disclosure obligations under Senate Rule 
 Continuation of a personal and official relationship with Mr Chang under circumstances
where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself in part through a pattern of
attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of several years when you
and your Senate Office were taking official actions of benefit to Mr Chang contacting United
States Government officials writing letters to foreign government officials and involving Mr 
Chang of his representatives in situations where you were meeting with officials of foreign
governments evidenced poor judgment 
 The committee has also considered that the principal source of the allegations against you
is David Chang a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the Department of
Justice a United States district judge and his own conduct In court documents the government
noted that Chang could not be trusted On May Mr Chang was convicted of attempting to
corruptly persuade a witness to give false testimony a conspiracy to violate the federal
election law and four violations of the federal election law 
 After evaluating the extensive body of evidence before it and your testimony the committee
is troubled by incongruities inconsistencies and conflicts particularly concerning actions
taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Mr Chang 
Therefore the committee expresses its determination that your actions and failure to
act led to violations of Senate rules and related statutes and created at least the appearance
of impropriety and you are hereby severely admonished 
Further the committee notes section c of the Senate Gift Rule concerning anything
which is paid for at market value or returned as well as your commitment to pay for any
item which the committee might conclude were in violation of the rules and has further
concluded that you must pay Chang an amount sufficient to bring the total to fair market retail
value of the TV and CD player as well as the fair market retail value of the earrings given to
the three individuals at your home with appropriate interest The committee understands that
you have previously delivered the bronze statues to the Department of Justice from whence they
should be returned to Chang 



MCCALL AD LONG ON INTRODUCTION
By SHAILA K DEWAN 
NEW YORK

This  second commercial is the first in H Carl
McCalls campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor and
will be broadcast upstate in major broadcast markets and on cable
in New York City starting today 
 
ON THE SCREEN

The words  His resume is an American dream   a quotation from
Time magazine appear on the screen A series of snapshots and
images are then a visual resume for McCall They show him as an
Army lieutenant at his swearing in as a state senator as
ambassador to the United Nations surrounded by children as New
York City school board president and at other jobs leading up to
his current position state comptroller A photograph of the
candidate standing in his Army uniform next to his mother is shown 
then the advertisement shifts to McCall talking about education 
while images of the candidate looking at a computer screen with a
small child and of him surrounded by children appear The action
then shifts to him in an office speaking to the camera as the
words  Experience Excellence Carl McCall  appear on the screen 
 
THE SCRIPT
A male voice says  Time Magazine called his life an American
dream Carl McCall Army lieutenant state senator ambassador to
the United Nations school board president Citibank vice
president and one of the most effective comptrollers in New York
history  
 
The candidate says  I grew up poor with a single mother She
said educations a sledgehammer It can open doors to opportunity 
Thats what education did for me As governor Ill make sure that
every kid in New York has the same opportunity I had to get a good
education  
 
ACCURACY
 
This advertisement is long on introductions and short on claims
of merit Thus most of the facts presented are a matter of record 
He had the title of ambassador when he was at the United Nations 
but he was not the chief of the American mission And Time magazine
actually called his resume not his life an American dream but it
also followed that up with a reference to his life saying he was
one of six children and raised on welfare As for the claim about
his success as comptroller where he controls the state pension
funds there is no disputing the funds growth during his terms 
but some critics say it had more to do with the buoyancy of the
stock market in the s than skilled management 
 
SCORECARD
 
The advertisement attempts to make several points and reach
several different constituencies For one it counters the high
name recognition of Andrew M Cuomo McCalls opponent by offering
voters a straightforward introduction to the candidate emphasizing
his long list of high level jobs in both the public and private
sector It also emphasizes leadership an important campaign issue
after Sept At the same time it gives McCall a chance to
intertwine his boot straps story with the broader issue of children
and education a priority of many Democratic voters 
 
 


NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS TRANSSEXUALS DEATH SENTENCE

By LAURA MANSNERUS
TRENTON N J 
The New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday
overturned the death sentence of Leslie Ann Nelson a transsexual
go go dancer who killed a police officer and an investigator with
an AK  rifle 
 
The court vacating Nelsons death sentence for the second time 
ruled on two grounds that the jury could have been confused by
instructions on the verdict sheet and that the prosecutor made
improper accusations in his closing argument Nelson had been
the only woman of people on New Jerseys death row 
 
The ruling which does not affect Nelsons guilty plea sends
the case back to the trial court for resentencing The state
attorney generals office has not decided whether to seek the death
penalty again a spokesman Peter Aseltine said Tuesday 
 
The court upheld the sentence of another death row inmate 
Robert O Marshall convicted of arranging the murder of his wife
at a picnic area on the Garden State Parkway 
 
In its  to  decision in the Nelson case the court showed
continuing uneasiness with the death penalty as it has done even
since adopting a voluminous set of review procedures in to
govern capital cases New Jersey has not had an execution since
 
 
Justice James R Zazzali and Justice Virginia Long said in a
separate opinion that in addition to the reasons given in the
majority opinion also written by Zazzali they believed the death
penalty would constitute cruel and unusual punishment because of
Nelsons history of emotional disturbance Zazzali and Long had
expressed similar reservations in June when the court
overturned the death sentence of Thomas J Koskovich who was 
when he killed two pizza deliverymen in an ambush 
 
The majority opinion Tuesday said the court would impose higher
standards in capital cases when reviewing prosecutors conduct and
possibly ambiguous jury instructions 
 
While all five members of the majority found the instructions to
the jury on weighing aggravating and mitigating factors to be
confusing two of those justices wrote in a partial dissent that
the prosecutors statements in his summation about the defenses
expert witnesses were within the bounds of acceptable argument 
 
Two of the courts members Chief Justice Deborah T Poritz and
Justice Peter G Verniero did not participate in the Nelson case
because both are former attorneys general 
 
Nelson born Glenn Nelson had severe psychological problems and
a history of reclusive behavior into adulthood and was convicted
on a weapons charge in After undergoing sex change surgery in
 she pursued a career as an exotic dancer 
 
In April while she was living with her parents in Haddon
Heights outside Philadelphia law enforcement officers arrived at
the house with a warrant for Nelsons arrest on another weapons
charge During a  hour standoff she killed a patrolman and an
investigator from the Camden County prosecutors office 
 
She pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to death by a
jury in The Supreme Court overturned that sentence in July
 ruling that the prosecution had failed to disclose important
information to the jury 
 
A second jury sentenced Nelson to death in March 
 
In Marshalls case the   decision upheld a lower courts
dismissal of his petition for further review of his murder
conviction Marshall an insurance agent from Toms River was
convicted of hiring a man to kill his wife while the couple were
going home after an evening of dining and gambling in Atlantic
City The case was the subject of Joe McGinniss best selling book
 Blind Faith  
 
 
 

EDITORIAL THE SHAME OF EGYPT 

The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday July 
 

President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt describes himself as Americas
leading Arab ally Yet his anti democratic behavior is an
embarrassment to Washington and an affront to his own people The
latest example is Mondays re sentencing of Saad Eddin Ibrahim a
sociologist and human rights activist to seven years in prison for
his efforts to register voters monitor elections and report
attacks on Egypts Coptic Christians 
 
Ibrahim who holds dual United States and Egyptian citizenship 
is years old and ailing The verdict should be annulled not
just on humanitarian grounds but because his prosecution is an
abrogation of the most basic standards of justice Ibrahims harsh
punishment sends a chilling message to Egyptians yearning for a
more accountable and tolerant society 
 
Egyptian courts are neither fair nor independent Like every
other government institution they hew closely to Mubaraks wishes 
That is especially true of the State Security Court that ruled in
this case Ibrahim might never have been tried had he not written
an article taking note of Mubaraks efforts to create a
presidential dynasty Nor is it likely his sentence would have been
reaffirmed if Mubarak believed that convicting an American citizen
for promoting democracy and human rights might jeopardize his own
standing with the Bush administration and the billion annual
American subsidy that keeps his government afloat 
 
That aid bonanza was granted to reward Mubaraks predecessor 
Anwar Sadat for signing a peace treaty with Israel Washington has
never demanded good governance and democracy from Cairo in return 
In recent months President Bush has spoken of the need to promote
democracy in the Arab world But so far he has pushed the point
only with the Palestinians It is time to extend this policy to
Egypt 
 
While hardly the worst example of dictatorship in the Middle
East Egypt is one of the saddest It is a country with a long and
glorious history a substantial middle class a peace treaty with
Israel and large quantities of American aid Under Mubarak it has
squandered economic and diplomatic opportunities and relentlessly
stifled political debate Its official media are awash in
anti American and anti Semitic propaganda 
 
The State Department and American officials in Cairo have issued
diplomatically phrased protests of Ibrahims trial and sentence 
This is entirely insufficient What is needed is a message
delivered personally by Bush and other top officials not only about
the inexcusable treatment of Ibrahim but of the contemptuous
approach to democratic values 
 



EDITORIAL GOVERNOR PATAKI WEIGHS IN

The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday July 
 

Responding to a wave of public dismay over the first designs for
rebuilding Lower Manhattan Gov George Pataki has sent word that
its time to go back to the drawing board It is the right message 
sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive
about the disappointing quality of the work so far The governor 
like Mayor Michael Bloomberg now seems committed to creating a
better mix of uses for ground zero and a  hour community in
Manhattans downtown 
 
While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding
schedule slightly it does not need to stall progress if the
governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey New York
cannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its
process for rebuilding what was destroyed 
 
Pataki openly questioned the Port Authoritys requirement that
any plan for the site replace all the office hotel and retail
square footage lost in the attack on Sept More than anything
else that specification limited the designs to the undistinguished
options presented two weeks ago Renegotiating that issue with the
World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately Opening
the process to other designers both here and internationally will
help separate this urban plan from the ordinary 
 
The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens
underground in particular with the transportation network At this
point planners have focused on short term repair of PATH and
subway lines with medium range proposals being shopped in
Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines
downtown Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about
how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region 
 
Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and
building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been
popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals But it
would be expensive and the governor the mayor and their friends
in Washington will have to look at long range ways to pay the bill 
 
Patakis recent remarks are a sign that he understands how
central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own
political legacy Now he needs to follow through with action to
keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best
possible plan not simply keeping the issue on hold until after
this falls election 

 


EDITORIAL A PALLID CLEAN AIR PLAN
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday July 
 

President Bush has now unveiled his long awaited  Clear Skies 
proposal which he promises will simplify and strengthen the Clean
Air Act without crippling American industry A debate on how to
make the  year old Clean Air Act a stronger and more efficient
instrument is surely long overdue But the Bush plan falls well
short of the only other credible proposal on the table a bill
sponsored by Sen James Jeffords Independent of Vermont 
 
Like Jeffords the president calls for substantial reductions in
three major pollutants    the nitrogen oxides that produce smog 
sulfur dioxide which causes acid rain and mercury But he ignores
emissions of carbon dioxide the main global warming gas That is a
huge omission Even for the pollutants he addresses Bushs
timetable is too leisurely He aims to reduce all three by 
percent by The Jeffords proposal would make the same sizable
reductions by Finally the Bush proposal would roll back key
provisions of the existing Clean Air Act that Jeffords would keep 
 
Bush argues that the regulatory mechanisms he has in mind for
reaching Clear Skies goals chiefly a market based emissions
trading scheme will be so effective that the need for many
existing rules will disappear This page has long embraced
emissions trading as an essential tool for reducing pollution at
manageable cost We also agree that the law needs streamlining But
some regulations aimed at specific regional problems that
nationwide trading alone is unable to address cannot lightly be
abandoned 
 
Among these are rules governing emissions that limit visibility
in the national parks and rules governing pollution that drifts
eastward from Midwestern power plants Indeed Bush has already
made clear his intention to roll back one of the most important of
these regulations a provision known as new source review that
compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever
they significantly upgrade older plants 
 
The Clean Air Act is a landmark statute deserving of
thoughtful improvement The Bush bill as written is not the way
to get there

ANGELS MAKE TRADE TO GET OUTFIELD DEPTH

 For use by NYTimes News Service clients 
By JOE HAAKENSON 
c San Gabriel Valley Tribune 



 ANAHEIM Calif    The Anaheim Angels got help where they felt
they
needed it most agreeing to trade for Milwaukee Brewers outfielder
Alex Ochoa only hours before Wednesdays nonwaiver trading
deadline 


 In addition to Ochoa the Angels got minor league catcher Sal
Fasano In return the Brewers got backup catcher Jorge Fabregas
and
two players to be named later By rule the players to be named
later
cannot be players on the active major league roster 


 In the past week the Angels deemed outfield depth their biggest
need above adding a reliever to the bullpen Orlando Palmeiro was
the only backup outfielder on the major league roster and the
outfielders in the minor league system are too inexperienced to be
counted on in a pennant race 


 In Ochoa the Angels get an experienced major league
outfielder
who is hitting with six homers and RBI this season Ochoa
has
played in the majors for five different teams starting in His
best season came in with the Reds when he hit with 
homers and RBI Going into this season he was a career 
hitter 


  He gives you a lot in all areas   Angels general manager Bill
Stoneman said  Hes a good defender he has a good arm he plays
the tough right field position and plays it well he’s a
right handed
bat which complements Palmeiro off the bench 


  From a realistic standpoint were we going to find an
outfielder
that pushed one of our outfielders to the bench  The answer is no 
He
accepts his role with a club and he’s a team guy he’s got that
reputation and that’s important to us especially a club like ours
that is an egoless club  


 Ochoa will join the club today in Anaheim before tonights game
against the Yankees He said he’s fine with his role as a reserve
outfielder and pinch hitter 


  Ive done that a lot in my career   Ochoa said during a
conference call  Coming in theyve got three great outfielders 
I
knew that from the get go  


 Ochoas new teammates were generally pleased with the move even
if
it wasn’t a blockbuster 


  Its not the big earth shattering stuff   right fielder Tim
Salmon said  But we didn’t need something earth shattering right
now It didn’t seem like we had a lot of holes to fill Its good 
it
gives us something we didn’t have and we didn’t lose much  


   Its because of Molina The Angels felt they could part with
Fabregas because of the play of catcher Jose Molina Molina spent
all
season at Triple A Salt Lake before joining the major league club
July to replace his injured brother Bengie 


 Bengie is expected to be activated from the disabled list today 
giving the Angels both Molina brothers on the active major league
roster for the first time 


  I feel bad for Jorge he’s a good friend of mine   Bengie
said 
 But they liked the way Jose has played and theyre giving him a
chance i’m very excited well be on the same team for a while  


 Jose went into Wednesdays game hitting and had thrown out
 
percent two of six of baserunners trying to steal Angels

OLYMPIC JUDGING SCANDAL DEEPENS WITH ARREST OF RUSSIAN CRIME
FIGURE 

 EDS SUBS for rewriting throughout 
By RICHARD SANDOMIR 
c New York Times News Service 



 A Russian accused of being in organized crime was arrested in
Italy on Wednesday on an American complaint that he conspired to
fix the pairs figure skating and ice dancing competitions at the
recent Salt Lake Winter Olympics which were dominated by the
sports judging scandals 


 The Russian Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov who was arrested by the
Italian authorities at his resort home in Forte dei Marmi appeared
to have a singular motivation for rigging the competitions getting
a visa to return to France where he once lived 


 The federal prosecutor in Manhattan alleged in a criminal
complaint that Tokhtakhounov had conceived and directed a scheme
with a second man alleged to be in the Russian mob and a member of
the Russian Skating Federation to secure a gold medal for the top
Russian pairs skaters and for the top French ice dancers one of
whom is a Russian 


 The Russian team of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze
narrowly won the gold medal over the Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier who were later awarded a duplicate gold medal because of
the ensuing judging controversy Sale and Pelletier declined to
comment on Wednesday 


 The French ice dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat 
later won the gold over a Russian team 


 The complaint casts the Salt Lake City figure skating scandal in
a more serious light than the cronyism and vote swapping that have
tainted the increasingly troubled sport Over the past four years 
four judges have been suspended including a Ukrainian who was
taped by a Canadian judge detailing the order of finish for the ice
dancers before the Winter Games in Nagano Japan 


 If convicted of the charges against him    conspiracy to commit
wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bribery both felonies  
Tokhtakhounov faces maximum prison time of years and a fine of
 or more The United States is seeking his extradition from
Italy 


 The Italian authorities provided the FBI with information from
wiretaps of Tokhtakhounovs home telephone part of an
investigation into his criminal activities The FBI said explicit
conversations about the scheme had been recorded between
Tokhtakhounov and his conspirators and between him and Anissina 
who was born in Russia and skated for France and her mother 


 The FBI cited a vivid conversation with Anissinas mother in
which Tokhtakhounov assured her that even if her daughter  falls 
we will make sure she is No  


 After the Winter Olympics a French judge Marie Reine Le
Gougne was suspended by the International Skating Union for not
reporting pressure she said was put on her by Didier Gailhaguet 
president of the French Skating Federation to vote for the Russian
pairs team 


 She later recanted and said that Canadian officials had
pressured her The ISU later suspended Le Gougne and Gailhaguet for
three years 


 The federal complaint did not describe the possibility of a
wider conspiracy or any contact between Tokhtakhounov or his
unnamed co conspirators with Le Gougne 


  We have alleged no connection between this man with any
officials other than with Russian federation officials   James B 
Comey the U S attorney for the Southern District of New York 
said at a news conference 


 He said that Tokhtakhounov  reached out to a co conspirator 
somebody connected to the Russian Skating Federation who did the
legwork for him  


 Maxwell Miller Le Gougnes lawyer in Salt Lake City said no
evidence of organized crime influence came up in her suspension
hearings before the ISU  I think this situation vindicates the
argument that weve made all along   he said  Shes a scapegoat
and a target of a corrupt system and was unfairly singled out  


 Tokhtakhounov whose age was given by Comey as or is a
 major figure in international Eurasian organized crime   Comey
said 


 Born in Tashkent Uzbekistan and now a Russian citizen he is
known as Taivanchik or Little Taiwanese for his Central Asian
ethnic background Since the collapse of the Soviet Union he has
been implicated in arms trading and Russian art smuggling and in
the Russian news media he was accused of complicity in a plot to
extort million from the head of a Russian sports foundation 


 He appears to have moved to France in according to news
media reports and is reported to have Israeli citizenship also 
Comey said Tokhtakhounov had three residences in Italy Forte dei
Marmi Rome and Milan 


 The complaint against Tokhtakhounovs traces his contact with
figure skating to when he proposed to Gailhaguet the creation
of a professional hockey team in Paris that would provide revenue
for the French Skating Federation Gailhaguet and Anissina are
not referred to by name in an accompanying FBI agents affidavit 
but by their descriptions their identities are obvious 


 In return Gailhaguet told the FBI on Feb as the Olympics
were taking place Tokhtakhounov asked for Gailhaguets help in
renewing his French visa which was about to expire 


 But when Gailhaguet sought guidance from a French government
official he was told that  Tokhtakhounovs money is bad   the
affidavit said 


 The federal complaint offers many details of the alleged
conspiracy including excerpts from a transcript of the Italian
wiretaps 


 later suspended Le Gougne and Gailhaguet for three years 


 The federal complaint did not describe the possibility of a
wider conspiracy or any contact between Tokhtakhounov or his
unnamed co conspirators with Le Gougne

not referred to by name in an accompanying FBI agents affidavit

renewing his French visa which was about to expire

official he was told that   Tokhtakhounovs money is bad   the
affidavit said 


 The federal complaint offers many details of the alleged
conspiracy including excerpts from a transcript of the Italian
wiretaps 


 On Feb the Italian wiretaps recorded Tokhtakhounovs request
to someone identified as another Russian mobster to get the number
of a Russian Skating Federation official The second mobster told
Tokhtakhounov that the federation official  is close to us    he is
a good guy he will do it  


 Tokhtakhounovs action apparently came soon after he said he
received a phone call from the mother of the female ice dancer 
presumably Anissina 


 A week later after Berezhnaya and Sikharulidzes pairs victory 
the mobsters spoke again The second mobster expressed satisfaction
with the outcome of the competition and suggested that
Tokhtakhounov could call the ice dancers  mother or the father
and tell them everything will be OK  He appears to be referring to
Anissina 


 The second mobster added  Our Sikharulidze fell the Canadians
were times better and in spite of that the French with their
vote gave us first place   He added  Everything is going the way
you need it  


 They also discussed the coming judging in ice dancing in which
the French and the Italian teams were the favorites The second
mobster said the French pair had  only three judges   and of the
two judges they needed to win the gold medal  one is ours and the
other our friends will give them   Their concern for lining up
more votes than they thought the Italian ice dancers had may stem
from the Italian teams defeat of Anissina and Peizerat in the 
world championships 


 But they seemed pleased that the Russian pairs victory was
achieved with the French judges vote  The French have nothing
but the ice dancing   the second mobster said 


 Again Tokhtakhounov voiced his need to have his French visa
extended and he said Anissina had tried to help him but Gailhaguet
had thwarted her 


 Also on Feb a week before the ice dancing finals 
Tokhtakhounov told Anissinas mother in a telephone call that the
Russian federation official  had called me from America  to
assure that  we are going to make  Anissina  an Olympic
champion   He told her that the Russian skating federation
official  will help    he has two or three judges  


 On or about March in a conversation between Tokhtakhounov and
Anissina she said she would have won the event without his
assistance because the Russian judge did not vote for her and her
partner 


 She also apologized for not calling to thank him earlier but
that Gailhaguet had forbidden her She told Tokhtakhounov that she
knew the FBI had interviewed Gailhaguet because of information that
Tokhtakhounov  was involved with the results  of the ice dancing 
He assured her that it was nonsense but that Gailhaguet  knows my
name very well    he tried to help me and later he made stuff up to
scare you so you would not connect me to him even more  


 The conversations seem to indicate a familiarity between
Tokhtakhounov and Anissina Tass the official Russian news agency 
reported that Anissina attended a ceremony in at a Paris hotel
honoring Tokhtakhounov for his philanthropy 


 That Russian organized crime may have infiltrated international
sport at the Olympics stunned Phyllis Howard president of the U S 
Figure Skating Association 


  This is a criminal act and it certainly puts things in a
different league   Howard said 


 Lloyd Ward chief executive officer of the U S Olympic
Committee said in a statement  Competitors from all nations must
be assured that they compete on a level playing field

 IBM OPENS BILLION CHIP PLANT IN UPSTATE NEW YORK 
 SUBS st
 graf with CORRECTION No other changes 
 By STEVE LOHR 
 c New York Times News Service 



 EAST FISHKILL N Y    IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated
semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 
billion to build and equip the largest single capital investment
the company has ever made 


 The factory which opens as the computer chip business is in a
slump is a costly and risky move for IBM But it is also an
expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a
technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor
industry and a commitment that the best place to execute that
strategy is in upstate New York 


 IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still
invests heavily in research to advance the design manufacture and
materials used in semiconductor chips It is spending more than
 million a year on semiconductor research and development 


 The factory will produce a wide range of specialized
semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe
computers to cell phones and video game consoles 


 The new plant is part of IBMs push to gain a strong lead in
chip making beyond the personal computer business where Intel and
East Asian chip producers hold the advantage 


  The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack
the high performance segments of the market   said John Kelly 
senior vice president in charge of IBMs technology group 


 An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory
here Kelly explained was that it was very close to its research
laboratories in nearby Westchester County N Y To stay ahead in
advanced chip technology he said moving innovations out of the
labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial 


  What we call the lab to fab time should be as close to zero as
possible   Kelly said  If our strategy were anything but to be
on the leading edge wed have put the plant in Asia  


 The new factory which will begin normal production early next
year will employ about people 


 BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM 


 In remarks during a ribbon cutting ceremony here on Wednesday 
Gov George E Pataki said he expected the facility to generate
thousands more jobs in the Hudson Valley area for contractors and
suppliers catering to the factory He praised IBM for being  a
critical partner in our economic development efforts  in New York
state 


 In a brief speech Samuel J Palmisano IBMs chief executive 
emphasized that it was important to make long term investments
despite the current slump in the technology business  To play to
win in technology you innovate and you lead   he said 


 But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical
business In June IBM announced that it was taking a charge of
more than billion against earnings The largest single reasons
for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of
manufacturing hard disks for storage which it sold to Hitachi and
closing down some of its older semiconductor operations 


 But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips like those
produced at IBMs facility in Burlington Vt is strong  I need
more capacity in that end of the market   he said  and this is
factory is critical to meeting that growing demand  


 If IBM has miscalculated the demand it will suffer badly as
both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital
investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings But
industry analysts said the plant should be insulated from a falloff
in one or a few segments of the semiconductor market 


 END OPTIONAL TRIM 


 The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly
to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand  The
diversity is the big difference with this plant   said Richard
Doherty president of Envisioneering a research firm  It gives
IBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips 
and the world is going to custom chips  


 The  square foot plant is a testament to advanced
manufacturing technology The  millimeter silicon wafers    about
the size of a standard pizza    are shuttled around the facility in
enclosed plastic pods which ride on overhead tracks They drop
down from wires automatically into machines sheathed in stainless
steel and glass for each stage of processing and fabrication 


 Throughout the processing steps which typically last 
days the wafers are not touched by human hands The circuits
etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a
human hair 


 Human operators are there to monitor the systems catch errors
and fine tune the production process for maximum efficiency 
Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is
self enclosed and essentially airtight the uniforms operators
wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip
plants which looked like space suits 


 The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon
uniforms light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made
of paper They look more like workers in a bakery 


 Yes said Richard Brilla director of the new facility  but
the donuts are a lot more costly here   Each wafer holding
hundreds of chips is worth to apiece depending on
what insulation circuitry and materials are used

 BIRMINGHAM Ala    Since he took the head coaching job at

 So    does he   Yeah I do   said Johnson who has a full head
of gray hair in common with the comedian turned playwright  I was
stopped in San Francisco one time by a Japanese tour bus I swear 
They all thought I was Steve Martin They jumped out and said 
`Hollywood Hollywood I got my picture taken with them and signed
a few Steve Martin autographs  


 Johnson will be signing plenty of autographs with his own name

  Im planning to win every game we play   he said 


 Just another wild and crazy guy 


 Date with destiny After Vanderbilt opens with Georgia Tech the
Commodores will play host to Furman which is Johnsons former team
and a Division I AA powerhouse 


 Did he consider trying to cancel   Let me just say that three
years ago when we scheduled that game I was feeling pretty good
about it   Johnson said  Theyre seasoned they know how to win
and were going to have to deal with that Theyre going to be
tough to beat

end Lorenzo Diamond said  and that’s a big motivational factor
for us 


  But I think weve moved past last season We havent totally
forgotten about it but were looking forward to this upcoming

go

 THE PRODUCE BIN Bitter melon 
 
 BY KAROLA SAEKEL 
c The San Francisco Chronicle 


SAN FRANCISCO    A staple of Chinese and Indian cooking these
gourds botanically Momordica charantia with skin like toads
grow on climbing vines that can reach feet The Chinese and
Indian varieties differ little in taste Though they resemble
squashes they are natives to Asia rather than the Americas but
are now cultivated in many regions of the world that boast
moderate to warm climates Hmong farmers grow them in
Californias Central Valley and Mexico has a substantial crop 


 SEASON Bitter melons can be found in Asian and specialty
produce markets primarily from spring through late fall Right
now some particularly nice ones are in Bay Area farmers
markets 


 HOW TO SELECT As the gourd ripens its color changes from
near white pale green to vivid green often flecked with yellow 
and eventually bright orange When young the flavor is
relatively mild with a fresh sour note As it ripens it gets
progressively more bitter due to the quinine it contains 


 PRICE Bitter melon was selling for cents to a pound
last week 


 USES Bitter melons are used in many Asian cuisines most
prominently Indian Chinese and Vietnamese Generally they are
halved lengthwise the seeds and fibrous pulp removed and the
flesh sliced into crescents They are frequently blanched or
salted and left to macerate for up to an hour then rinsed and
patted dry to tame the bitterness 


 Chinese hot and sour soup made with egg white and crabmeat
often includes bitter melon It also appears in stir frys 
especially those based on pork Black bean sauce is a favorite
seasoning When pickled bitter melon makes a savory condiment 


 In Vietnam bitter melon halves are stuffed with meat
mixtures such as ground pork with black mushrooms and cellophane
noodles then braised Colin Spencers  Vegetable Book  details
an intriguing Indian chapati in which bitter melon seeds left
intact is sliced parboiled then mixed with lightly fried
garlic and Indian spices flour and yogurt The mixture is fried
like a thick pancake and served sliced with rice naan and
other curries

 Grande dame of cooking still going strong at Julia Child 
 celebrates in San Francisco 
 
 BY KAROLA SAEKEL 
c The San Francisco Chronicle 


 
SAN FRANCISCO    How does it feel to turn and have attained
the status of an icon a living legend 


  It feels just like it felt before   Julia Child says with
the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary
teeth on her  French Chef  television series The show along
with her seminal book  Mastering the Art of French Cooking 
 revolutionized the way America cooks and eats 


 While making light of the difference a day    or another
decade    makes Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly 
First there will be all the public observances including a
sold out dinner Thursday at San Franciscos tony Fifth Floor
restaurant which    like dinners that night at other venues
across the country    will benefit the scholarship fund of the
International Association of Culinary Professionals which Child
co founded 


 Friday to Sunday the action moves to Napa with both
members only and public events at COPIA The American Center for
Wine Food and the Arts of which she is an honorary board
member 


 Aug her actual birthday will see her in Maine at an
annual gathering of nieces nephews their offspring and friends 
who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for
several members of the group into a jolly reunion 


 The schedule Child and her assistant of years former
pastry chef Stephanie Hersh have laid out is not exactly a
senior citizen routine even though Child has always been candid
about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities 


 When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her
long time home in the Boston area last year she also made the
move from a condominium she and her late husband Paul had
purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home She is
in the most active of the four levels available but should the
need arise she can move on to assisted living facilities within
the same complex 


  Julia   explains Hersh  made these retirement plans many
years ago She thinks its selfish for people not to make
arrangements for their old age in good time  


 But so far age has been kind to the ebullient Child In a
phone interview a couple of weeks ago she reported with glee
that surgery early this month to remove a small cyst on her
spinal cord had  miraculously  cleared up recent problems in
walking  Turned out there is nothing wrong with my legs at
all  


 So she can once again go shopping buying whatever seems best
on any given day Though she had a  nice  kitchen installed in
her new home Child said its like a ships galley    a far cry
from the huge three pantry kitchen Paul Child designed for their
house in Cambridge That may well be the best known kitchen in
America since it became the site of the  French Chef 
television programs which started airing in 


  Back there we always ate in the kitchen   Child
reminisced  I cannot do that here   That means her
entertaining has been curtailed even though she still has an
active social life with the many friends the Childs made during
 winters spent in Santa Barbara 


 She will have reunions of sorts with her famous kitchen in
the next few weeks One of its Peg Board walls was dismantled and
reinstalled at COPIA the rest went to Washington D C and the
Behring Center of the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum
of American History all CQ Hersh recalls the museum staffs
approach to preserving the famous kitchen as awesome They
cataloged and photographed everything from stove to windows 
blinds to drawer contents As reinstalled in Washington the
kitchen should be as we all remember it from countless TV shows 
 right down to the toothpicks  


 Child will go to the capital for the debut of the exhibit
right after the Maine birthday bash To see her kitchen    and by
extension herself    enshrined in the Smithsonian she said 
 will be an odd feeling  and no doubt bring back memories 


 But Child is not one to get maudlin about the past though
she does want to keep it alive she’s already got her next
project picked out A memoir of her and Pauls life in the
diplomatic service with his professional photographs and some of
her collected recipes 


 It will undoubtedly retell how the seeds of her culinary
career were sown Fresh off the boat on their way to Paris and
Paul Childs new posting they had met in Sri Lanka during World
War II they stopped for lunch in Rouen That lunch lit a spark
that made Julia decide to take classes at the Cordon Bleu which
in turn led to her friendship and collaboration with Simone Beck
and Louisette Bertholle co authors of  Mastering the Art of
French Cooking   and ultimately to Americas culinary
revolution

How to feed a legend


So what do you prepare when asked to cook a birthday dinner
for Americas most famous culinary personality 


 Some of the countrys top chefs will answer that question
Thursday at the dinners nationwide that will celebrate Julia
Childs approaching th birthday The question may be most acute
for three San Francisco chefs preparing the long sold out dinner
at Fifth Floor restaurant because the honoree herself plans to
be there 


 They are the host restaurants executive chef Laurent Gras 
his counterpart at Masas Ron Siegel and Masa pastry chef Keith
Jeanminette 


 The three put their heads together thumbed through

Julia Child I think of the television episode where she’s showing
you how to make a turkey dinner and the turkey fell on the floor 
Its live and she leans over and picks it up and says `What the
guests don’t see wont hurt them You have to be playful and
confident about cooking She cooks that way and I cook that
way

 UNDATED Chefs and seafood retailers are wading into one of the
hottest natural resource issues of the day fisheries management 


 Its no longer unusual for chefs to refuse to serve a species
they think to be at risk of extinction or for a retailer to promote
seafoods that are abundant and part of a healthy marine ecosystem 


 Most say theyre driven by the desire to do right by the
environment Some also say they must listen to their customers
concerns or risk a consumer backlash 


 The nationwide boycott of Chilean seabass is a potent example of
the new activism 


  I have made it a policy of mine never to serve Chilean
seabass   said Billy Hahn executive chef at Jakes Famous
Crawfish a Portland Ore landmark since  I refuse to sell
it  


 Chilean seabass also known as Patagonian toothfish came into
vogue in the s in U S restaurants and fish markets With
rising demand for the firm oil rich fish came pirate fishing
fleets eager to cash in on its popularity    even if it meant
skirting catch limits and environmental regulations 


 Contrary to what some restaurants and retailers tell their
customers the U S government does not consider the Chilean
seabass to be endangered But in some areas the seabass are being
overfished 


 That is potentially a problem because Chilean seabass are a
long lived species    living as long as years    and reproduce
slowly said Susan Buchanan a spokeswoman for the federal
governments National Marine Fisheries Service 


 The NMFS estimates that in more than tons of
Chilean seabass were legally caught from an internationally
regulated harvest area in the Antarctic Ocean But more than 
tons may have been taken illegally from those same waters the
fisheries service said 


 Impatient with regulators the National Environmental Trust
began a boycott campaign in February called  Take a Pass on
Chilean Seabass   The Washington based conservation group says
more than restaurants have signed on 


 A number of restaurants not officially part of the National
Environmental Trust boycott also have stopped serving Chilean
seabass And its not just the white tablecloth crowd 


 Red Lobster with restaurants in the United States and
Canada dropped Chilean seabass from the menu in the past year
because of  sustainability  concerns said Wendy Spirduso 
communications director for the Orlando Fla  based chain 


 Some retailers also have pulled Chilean seabass 


  Weve discontinued selling swordfish Chilean seabass orange
roughy and marlin   said Mark Cockcroft national seafood buyer
for Wild Oats Markets a chain of stores  We are also taking
a real hard look currently at almost all species of shark though
we havent made a formal statement about that  


 Whole Foods Markets with stores nationwide also does not
sell Chilean seabass 


 All of this comes at a time when Americans are consuming more
seafood to pounds per person each year compared with 
pounds per person in and pounds in according to the
National Fisheries Institute an industry association 


 At the same time about half the worlds fisheries are being
fished to capacity 


 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
reports that percent to percent of stocks are  fully
exploited   meaning that catches have either reached or are close
to maximum limits Another percent to percent are
 overexploited   and percent to percent have been  depleted
or are recovering from depletion  


 The seafood industry is less than thrilled about this surge of
interest in ocean ecosystems from people who are not scientists 


 Fisheries management is best left to the experts said Thor
Lassen president of Ocean Trust a research and conservation
foundation partly financed by the fishing industry  It involves
very complicated choices that have to do with the biology of
species their life cycles how they respond to various changes in
the oceans etc  


 When theres a boycott Lassen said  its not
environmentalists or chefs making the sacrifice its coastal
communities  


 Rod Moore executive director of the West Coast Seafood
Processors Association suggests that activists with an agenda are
manipulating chefs and retailers 


 The conservation groups providing information to chefs and
retailers and lists of environmentally appropriate seafoods to
consumers are the same groups working to affect fisheries
management on the political and regulatory level Moore said 


 that’s simply good strategy said James Leape deputy director
of the conservation program for the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation in Los Altos Calif 


 In and the Packard Foundation awarded million in
marine fisheries conservation grants They included support for
marine reserves and money for fisheries management reform More
than million was given to projects aimed at educating the
general public 


  One of the principal concerns of the Packard Foundation is the
preservation of natural resources particularly in the oceans and
one of the greatest threats is overfishing   Leape said  We have
seen that raising consumer awareness and concern among restaurants
and retailers about a particular fishery can really make a
difference  

 
 OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS 


 The Monterey Bay Aquariums Web site rates different species of
fish for overfishing habitat damage and other factors The
California aquarium also created  Seafood Watch  wallet cards
designed to take to restaurants More than of the cards and
seafood guides have been distributed since said Jennifer
Dianto Seafood Watch program manager at the aquarium 


 Chefs and retailers around the country know they must be
prepared to deal with customers who arrive with the aquariums
seafood card in hand But in a business in which  hour shifts are
the norm some chefs worry about their lack of time to stay
informed about complicated rapidly changing fisheries management
issues 


 Some working chefs say they routinely review conservation group
Web sites government reports and industry sources 


  For me its very difficult to be certain that the information
which is given to me is real   said Eric Ripert chef at Le
Bernardin a four star seafood restaurant in Manhattan  I dont
know I don’t have enough information to know for example if
Chilean seabass is really disappearing or if its political
pressure  


 Despite being uncertain of its status Ripert pulled Chilean
seabass Le Bernardins menu also informs diners that the
restaurant will not serve swordfish to support efforts  to recover
the species  


  I don’t wish to be a spokesman for any campaign   Ripert
said  I do it as somebody who has a conscience and is caring

PRESCRIPTION PRIVILEGES MAKE SOME PSYCHOLOGISTS ANXIOUS

BY CHRISTINE SOARES 
 c Scientific American 
 
 Intending to ease consumer access to mental health care New
Mexico legislators in March passed a law allowing psychologists to
prescribe psychotropic medications such as antidepressants 
 
 The states action the first in the nation has the blessing of
the American Psychological Association APA which considers
prescriptive authority a logical extension of psychologists role
as health care providers But powerful groups including the
American Medical Association oppose the idea and have a surprising
source of support psychologists themselves some of whom call it a
radical experiment and fear that the most likely victim will be the
science of psychology 
 
  I am concerned that nonmedically trained people as legitimate
prescribers of drugs will not be accepted by the American public  
says psychologist Gerald C Davison of the University of Southern
California 
 
 The APA has spent more than million to help state
psychological associations develop and lobby for such prescription
privileges    or  RxP     legislation A total of state
psychology associations have task forces dedicated to developing
and lobbying for prescription privileges legislation 
 
 The version endorsed by the APA would license doctoral level
psychologists to independently prescribe psychotropic drugs after
completing hours of classroom instruction in neuroscience 
physiology and pharmacology followed by four months supervised
treatment of patients 
 
 Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other
prescribers such as M D psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who
have at least six years medical education and clinical experience 
 
 Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy
of medications Their greatest objection is to the notion of
turning psychology into a prescribing profession 
 
 In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind 
mood and behavior can be studied empirically the past decade 
Davison says has seen  exciting developments  that demonstrate
the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the
psychosocial behavioral models on which they are based 
 
  The timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to
convert it to a medical science   explains Elaine M Heiby of the
University of Hawaii who chairs a committee of the  member
American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is
concerned about the medicalization of psychology 
 
  Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients
interventions based on the best available psychological science
should be the APAs priority   argues Emory Universitys Scott
Lilienfeld president of the Society for a Science of Clinical
Psychology SSCP 
 
 More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology RxP
opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they
love They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm 
biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology
curriculum at the expense of traditional psychological science and
methodology 
 
 Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already
receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design
and evaluation 
 
 RxP opponents charge the APA with pushing its
prescription privileges agenda without adequately assessing support
for it in the field The  member SSCP is the only group within
the APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription
privileges 
 
 The APA has scheduled minutes at its meeting in August for an
RxP debate but its leadership believes it already has an accurate
sense of support for its RxP policy 
 
  Except for this small vocal minority we have just not gotten
a lot of groundswell against this from members   says APA
president Philip G Zimbardo of Stanford University 
 
 With prescription privileges now a reality in one state some
RxP opponents concede that it may be too late 
 
 This year four states besides New Mexico    Georgia Hawaii 
Illinois and Tennessee    have pending legislation for psychologist
prescription privileges Over the past decade state
legislatures have considered such laws 
 
 Between and a U S Department of Defense
psychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four
years training produced military psychologists who can write
prescriptions

 BC ATOMIC BOMB   COX 
 
 A mission to end a war 
 By DENISE GAMINO 
 Cox News Service 



 AUSTIN Texas    Tom Karnes was dialing for destiny but not
everyone wanted to cooperate 


 Karnes sat in his wood paneled office in a Quonset hut in the
middle of the Great Salt Lake Desert a black telephone to his ear 
He was tracking down men to join a group so secret he couldnt
admit it existed 


 On his metal desk were names of military men being ordered into
the organization He was calling bases all over the United States
to line up their transfer to the desert outside Salt Lake City 


  Where is the authority   asked one officer who didn’t want to
lose a valuable man under his command 


  Who says this   another commanding officer asked Karnes 


 Each time Karnes said what he had to  Call Air Force
headquarters if you don’t believe me  


 If they continued to resist he pulled out a secret code for
their bosses 


  This is a Silverplate request   he said 


 Silverplate code word for the historic mission that would end
World War II 


 Almost men were assembled n late to join the
top secret unit called the th Composite Group Col Paul
Tibbets the pilot who would drop the worlds first atomic bomb
over Hiroshima Japan was commander of the unit and chose the men 
And the first person he chose to join him was Karnes though he
couldnt reveal the mission to Karnes Karnes is a retired
history professor who lives in suburban Austin with his wife 
Virginia who also worked for the th as a civilian bookkeeper
for six months 


 Karnes was Tibbets adjutant the man in charge of writing the
orders and cajoling the transfer to the unit of servicemen
proficient in bombing mechanics ordnance engineering and
communications Tibbets picked the names and Karnes made it
happen 


 Tibbets hated paperwork Karnes thought it was a breeze 


 They were a wartime match that changed the world 


 Japan surrendered within days of the detonation of the atomic
bombs that killed people in Hiroshima on Aug and
 in Nagasaki three days later 


 The story of the th is a tale of an elite outfit that lived
in a bubble of secrecy and endured the taunts of other war weary
U S units that resented sharing a small Pacific island with the
 th which appeared exempt from combat Tinian Island was the
staging area where the th moved after its creation in the
desert 


 Karnes has never spoken publicly about his role as Tibbets
right hand administrative aide He never even told his story to
students in his years of teaching college 


 War is hell he says and when it was over he wanted to come
home and rejoin his young family and not dwell on it He earned a
doctorate in history from Stanford University and taught Latin
American history at Tulane University and Arizona State University 


 Next week marks the th anniversary of the atomic bombings As
always Karnes mind will drift to memories of his good friend
Tibbets who lives in Columbus Ohio 


 Each year on Aug  I always think of Paul Tibbets and how he
handled unbelievable responsibility   Karnes said 


 Karnes met Tibbets when the  year old bomber pilot walked into
Karnes office at Wendover Army Air Field on the Utah Nevada
border Karnes was the personnel and classification officer He was
only a captain but he had been left in charge at Wendover the day
Tibbets surprised them by landing a B  a new plane no one at
Wendover had seen 


 Tibbets had just been ordered to organize a combat force to drop
a bomb being developed by a secret enterprise known as the
Manhattan Project He was searching for a remote installation to
train bomber crews and support units in total secrecy 


 Tibbets instantly liked the isolation and vast size of Wendover
and the surrounding Bonneville Salt Flats And he immediately liked
Karnes who showed him around the base 


 In Karnes Tibbets found a kindred spirit    and a handball
partner Both were smart disciplined quiet men who thrived on
efficiency perfection and self reliance Each had skills the other
admired Tibbets was a decorated top gun pilot but Karnes could
wrangle the military rule book as well as Tibbets could fly 


  I don’t recall ever having to tell Tom to do anything  
Tibbets said in an e mail this week  He was so knowledgeable he
just got things done allowing me to concentrate on other matters 
I was very lucky to have Tom  


 Tibbets quickly returned to Wendover after that first visit to
set up his headquarters His first order appointed Karnes adjutant
for the th 


 Almost overnight Wendover became a high security base filled
with off limit areas covered in barbed wire No one was allowed to
talk about what they saw or heard even though most of the th
had no idea why they were there except that B  s were being
modified to carry a heavy load 


 Karnes and his staff read outgoing mail to make sure no secrets
slipped out Karnes hated to pry and skimmed over personal
portions of the letters Phone calls were monitored An undercover
force of Manhattan Project security agents infiltrated the base and
bars in the little town of Wendover population to spy on
airmen 


 Karnes knew the th was preparing for a special bombing
mission but he had no idea what kind of bombs were involved 


  I had a friend the finance officer He said that they had
split the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb  
Karnes said  I said `No  


 A noncommittal  mmm mm   was the most Karnes could ever get
out of Tibbets on matters of the bomb By spring the th
prepared to move to Tinian Island near Guam and Saipan That would
put the B  s about miles from Japan    a  hour round trip
flight Karnes was deluged with orders for inoculations equipment 
transfers and promotions 


 Karnes arrived on Tinian on May as part of an advance
team that flew in the five C  transport planes of the th On
May men arrived on the troopship Cape Victory after a
five week trip from Seattle 


 Tinian Island had been captured from Japan and the Seabees the
construction arm of the Navy had built two large airfields The
 th took North Field and stayed in relative isolation from other
B  units on the island 


 Karnes handed out bunk assignments choosing the mess officer 
Chuck Perry to share his tent Karnes had his own Jeep and went
to the beach and to evening movies shown by other units as often as
he could But at the movies he had to remove the distributor cap
on his Jeep so the vehicle would’nt  be stolen perhaps by jealous
airmen who resented the th 


 Not until the day before Tibbets and his crew flew to Hiroshima
was the th told what was happening The word spread  This is
it This is the big mission  


 Karnes and hundreds of other men from the th stood along the
flight line as Tibbets and the Enola Gay took off at a m on
Aug a warm tropical night Three B  s had gone ahead to check
the weather at Hiroshima and two other possible bomb sites Two
other B  s left in two minute intervals after Tibbets so their
crews could take photos and drop devices to measure radiation and
other effects of the bomb 


 Tibbets got the word only an hour from Hiroshima that the citys
weather was clear As they approached Tibbets braced for Japanese
anti aircraft fire None came Early in the flight the crew had
inserted a plug of uranium into the  pound bomb nicknamed
 Little Boy  


 Ninety seconds from the bomb drop Tibbets put the plane on
auto pilot The crew slipped on dark glasses to prepare for the
blinding flash of the bomb At a m Hiroshima time the
pneumatic bomb bay doors opened and  Little Boy   equivalent to
 tons of TNT fell out 


 Tibbets and his crew had exactly seconds to get away before
the bomb exploded The Enola Gay climbed and Tibbets fought to
turn the plane in the air bending  degree the crews had been
practicing off Tinian for months He pushed off the dark glasses
because he couldnt see to fly 


 When the bomb exploded as planned feet over Hiroshima 
Tibbets mouth tingled and


 he tasted the lead fillings in his teeth 


 A minute later the shock wave hit The crew was horrified by
the purple mushroom cloud that climbed to miles and looked as if
it would engulf the Enola Gay More shocking was the city of
Hiroshima which was on fire and bubbling like tar 


  We were all appalled   the pilot said in his book  The
Tibbets Story  


 Back on Tinian Karnes had gone to bed But he didn’t sleep
long Someone woke him to say Gen Hap Arnold chief of the Army
Air Forcesin Washington was on the phone and asking for him 
Arnold told Karnes  Tibbets is going to be landing in three to
four hours and I want to give him the Distinguished Service Cross 
and it is your job to write up the explanation  


  I had no idea how you wrote up an award Id never written up
any award   Karnes said  So I got all of my sergeants out and
theyre all digging through their books  


 When an unsuspecting Tibbets descended from the Enola Gay on
Tinian he barely managed to palm his pipe as Gen Carl Spaatz 
commander of the Strategic Air Forces stepped forward to pin the
medal on his bomb flight coveralls 


 Karnes like the hundreds of others gathered along the flight
line was jubilant He knew the war would soon be over and he would
be heading home A yearof secrecy and hard work wasover 


 Three days later another B  from the th bombed Nagasaki 
Five days later Japan surrendered and World War II was over 


 Today Karnes is frustrated that some of his fellow historians 
the ones he calls  revisionists   question the wisdom and
morality of the bombings What matters he believes is that his
generation thought the bomb should be dropped 


  We were not bloodthirsty guys   he said  We were convinced
then and I still am that we ended the war a year or two earlier 
And what the casualties would have been who knows    but heavy  


  On Tinian and probably elsewhere the Seabees were building
enormous hospitals while we were there   he said  Those
hospitals were not for us They were for an expected invasion of
Japan And then the casualties were going to be terrible  


 Karnes carries the image of hundreds of hospital beds in his
mind In his heart he holds the unshakable conviction that the
mission he helped organize saved America from disaster

The White House said President Bush has approved duty free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that arent produced in  significant quantities  in the U S the Virgin Islands and other U S possessions 

The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc for changes in the U S Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations Previously watch imports were denied such duty free treatment 

Timex had requested duty free treatment for many types of watches covered by different U S tariff classifications The White House said Mr Bush decided to grant duty free status for categories but turned down such treatment for other types of watches  because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U S and the Virgin Islands

Xerox Corp has told employees in its Crum Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying off about people or of the staff 

A spokeswoman for Crum Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost cutting move 

She said the move would result in a after tax charge of less than million to be spread over the next three quarters By comparison for the first nine months Xerox earned million or a share on revenue of billion 

Earnings at Xeroxs financial services operations actually rose slightly but that was largely because capital gains at Crum Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments

The program available to Upjohn employees years old or older could increase an individuals retirement benefits to In addition Upjohn is offering a one time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay 

Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the companys two year strategy to implement budget constraints and  an effective headcount control program   

But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have because few jobs will end up being eliminated  Its a cosmetic move   said Jonathan S Gelles of Wertheim Schroder Co 

According to Upjohns estimates only to of the eligible employees will take advantage of the plan Upjohn further estimated that about of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced As a result Upjohn will likely trim only about to of its more than jobs world wide 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday Upjohn shares rose cents to apiece 

An Upjohn spokesman said he had  heard nothing  to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors 

The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two year cost control strategy Earlier staff reduction moves have trimmed about jobs the spokesman said

			Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled
				employees is costing U S companies billions and eroding their

				government and private security experts at an all day conference on
				corporate electronic espionage  Hostile and even friendly nations
				routinely steal information from U S companies and share it with their
				own companies   said Noel D Matchett a former staffer at the federal
				National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc 
				Silver Spring Md It  may well be  that theft of business data is  as
				serious a strategic threat to national security  as it is a threat to
				the survival of victimized U S firms said Michelle Van Cleave the
				White Houses assistant director for National Security Affairs 
			The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of
				Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and
				Electronics Association a joint industry government trade group Any
				secret can be pirated the experts said if it is transmitted over the
				air Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars
				for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR
				recorder They need only position themselves near a companys satellite
				dish and wait  You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets
				at the same time   Mr Matchett said adding  Its a pretty good bet
				they wont get caught   The only way to catch an electronic thief he
				said is to set him up with erroneous information 
			Even though electronic espionage may cost U S firms billions of
				dollars a year most arent yet taking precautions the experts said By
				contrast European firms will spend million this year on electronic
				security and are expected to spend billion by Already many
				foreign firms especially banks have their own cryptographers 
				conference speakers reported Still encrypting corporate communications
				is only a partial remedy 
			One expert whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on
				condition that he would’nt  be named or quoted said the expected influx
				of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase
				the chances of computer maintenance workers for example doubling as
				foreign spies Moreover he said technology now exists for stealing
				corporate secrets after theyve been  erased  from a computers memory 
				He said that Oliver North of Iran Contra notoriety thought he had erased
				his computer but that the information was later retrieved for
				congressional committees to read No personal computer not even the one
				on a chief executives desk is safe this speaker noted 
			W Mark Goode president of Micronyx Inc a Richardson Texas firm

We don’t know who is winning the drug war in Latin America but we know whos losing it    the press 
Over the past six months six journalists have been killed and kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas    who often are one and the same    in Colombia 
Over the past years at least journalists have died there 
The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August trying to prevent their takeover of the country 

The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of editors and publishers from Latin America the United States the Caribbean and Canada attending the th general assembly of the Inter American Press Association in Monterrey Mexico this week 
On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador Colombias second largest newspaper 
The papers local administrator Maria Luz Lopez was shot dead and her mother wounded while her car was stopped for a red light 
An hour later the papers circulation manager Miguel Soler was shot and killed near his home 

The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspapers offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin 
They bombed the Bogota offices last month destroying its computer and causing million in damage 

El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff 
At Monterrey publisher Luis Gabriel Cano although shaken by the murders issued a statement saying  We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking 
They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war  
This comes from a man whose brother Guillermo was murdered in 

The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in todays editions 
Many will use a common editorial 
A final statement yesterday said  While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship death by assassination  

The report charged that Panamas Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before 
 Noriega has closed every independent newspaper radio and television station and arrested tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters   the statement declared 

It added  In Cuba public enemy No of press freedoms in the hemisphere repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever  
And in Nicaragua promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas  have not materialized  

As it happens the four countries cited Colombia Cuba Panama and Nicaragua are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left wing politics 
Noriega is close to Castro and may once have been his agent 
Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges he backed their takeover of Nicaragua 
In Colombia the drug financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M  which Castro has clearly backed 

Robert Merkel a former U S attorney handling drug indictments in Florida doesn’t think for a minute that Castros much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel 
 If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them   he told the Journals David Asman recently 

The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing 
This week the government arrested Jose Abello Silva said to be the fourth ranking cartel leader 
He will probably be extradited to the U S for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived 
Later another high ranking trafficker Leonidas Vargas was arrested and pounds of dynamite seized 
Mr Barco has refused U S troops or advisers but has accepted U S military aid 

President Bush has agreed to meet within days with Mr Barco President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem 
It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner rather than later 
After the Panama fiasco they will need some reassurance 
Certainly the Colombian press is much in need of that 

 
 
 
 
 
 A Physics of Semantics 
 
 
 Each of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory 
 Each is tentative and incomplete pointing but not fully adequate 
 Yet I persistently hope it is better to light one candle against what  the darkness  the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before 
 There are grounds reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries to doubt a physics of semantics 
 We are on shaky ground 
 Yet when the first hard frost comes when the birches have been swung their crimson leaves scattered carelessly when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn long legged knowing how winter is thin when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where perhaps something new is to be found 
 
 
 We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent able to manipulate the universe on its own behalfthe egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady powerful flight 
 The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom and perhaps more than the vaunted quark 
 But autonomous agents we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf we to whom  intentionality  and  purpose  are so inevitably attributed by our common languages we are by my definition of autonomous agents also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties 
 If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more a properdefinition of life itself then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where  purpose  is ascribed by all of us to one another 
 
 
 Semantics enters with purpose 
 For this to be true it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose say the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient be conscious 
 
 
 I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work then do extract work propagating work and constraint construction from their environment 
 
 
 Know how
 
 
 Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material 
 
 
 I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had individually and collectively the embodied know how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world 
 Indeed as I have emphasized before a biosphere is a self consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents ways of making a living and the search procedures mutation recombination as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents 
 Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of  jobs  that were widely filled the abundant niches of the bio sphere 
 There is in this whole self constructing system a wider know how beyond the know how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment 
 Yet clearly the know how is distributed 
 There is no autonomous agent no one who knows how the whole system works any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions deals steals hopes and frustrations 
 
 
 What in the world is  know how  
 Philosophers distinguish between  know how  and  know that  
 I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums 
  Know that  concerns propositions most conveniently human propositions 
 I know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese 
 I know that the earth circles the sun that the earth is roughly spherical that chairs are used to sit on 
  Know that  brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world 
 Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can  know that  with respect to propositions 
 
 
 Unlike  know that    know how  does not involve propositions about the world 
  Know how  involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world 
 The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest the athletic genius high jumping have the know how to do it 
 
 
 Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world 
 I certainly want to say yes without attributing consciousness in any way 
 Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes metabolic switching mechanical twitching sensing of glucose gradient swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations 
 It knows how all right even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business 
 But then try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention 
 
 
 Thank God for know how 
 Know that is a thin veneer on a four billion year old know how skill abundant in the biosphere 
 But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents it would seem is also graced by the selfsame know how 
 If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them 
 
 
 The know how is in these terms nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis work tasks sensing recording and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents 
 The know how is not outside that propagating organization 
 The know how is the propagating organization 
 
 
 Semantics
 
 
 All of which brings us inevitably to the brink of semantics 
 
 
 It is simple at its roots you see 
 An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is i food ii poison iii a signal iv neutral v something else 
 
 
 Once there is an autonomous agent there is a semantics from its privileged point of view 
 The incoming molecule is  yuck  or  yum  
 I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent 
 And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind 
 If yum then there will probably be more of this type of agent osprings of the first 
 If yuck it is not so likely this lineage will prosper 
 
 
 Once yuck and yum we are not far from C S Pierces meaning laden semiotic triad sign signified significans 
 Like it or not the glucose gradient is a sign a predictor of  more glucose that way  
 Granted the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain 
 In this restricted sense signs are causally correlated with that which is signified 
 By contrast the relation between the word  chair  and that which it signifies and on which I am now sitting is arbitrary 
 But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view 
 If so can  mere chemicals  be signs in the full Piercean sense 
 
 
 I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words 
 Consider first the famous genetic code 
 Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein 
 The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids the binding of the charged transfer RNAs anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is  translated  
 
 
 The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid 
 As J Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis 
 The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site 
 Because of this which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA 
 Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon codon matching mechanism 
 In short chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations 
 
 
 It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign signified and significans to the genetic code 
 It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling chemical and otherwise within and between autonomous agents as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that  warns  other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti insect secondary metabolites 
 
 
 The calculus that is Claude Shannons elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols 
 Nowhere in the core of Shannons work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning or semantics of the information enter 
 This is no criticism and is widely known and appreciated 
 There is however just a hint of semantics in Shannons view that the semantics resides in the  decoder  
 
 
 I cannot buy Shannons view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent 
 If not then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsperhaps a set of water filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways 
 The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding 
 
 
 But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner that sequence of events seems laden with semantics 
 If only the bacterium could tell us  Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me 
 i’ve run into that one before 
 I ducked under a boulder and he never sensed me 
 I made it home 
 Pass me some more glucose please Martha  
 
 
 I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and therefore cannot deduce that which will unfold 
 Thus among other things we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds 
 Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing 
 I too know the risks including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from  intentional talk  to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question 
 But patience 
 Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold but we also cannot even translatein the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsfrom legal talk to normal intentional talk let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound wave forms monitored and masses at space time lines as a description 
 
 
 Then let’s just be naive for the moment 
 The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agentsay an early bacteriumis somehow linked with the embodied know how of that agent in making a living or failing to make a living in its world 
 The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered context dependent set of causal implications of the event or signal in question 
 
 
  For want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of the shoe the horse was lost and for want of the horse the rider was lost   more or less said Benjamin Franklin 
 The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context dependent set of implications of the event or signal in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system 
 
 
 It seems hard to ascribe purpose in the sense of acting on its own behalf to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga 
 Of course there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological 
 After all I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf 
 Now five chapters later it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter energy and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf 
 My definition is a definitional circle 
 
 
 On the other hand while the definition is circular like F   MA and Darwins  natural selection  and  fitness   that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world 
 Stones and chairs are not by my definition autonomous agents 
 All living cells are 
 And the stunning fact directly before us every day is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf 
 Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest 
 
 
 In short once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere 
 
 
 Knowing
 
 
 What about  knowing  
 
 
 Daniel Dennett in his fine book Darwins Dangerous Idea advances a hierarchy of forms of  knowing   if I may use that term that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means 
 I find his hierarchy congenial and informative 
 Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher order entities via variation and natural selection 
 
 
 I do not disagree although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self organization in evolution 
 Here in Investigations I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy detect those sources of energy create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further 
 I wonder in short at the naturalness and self generaticity of Dennetts cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres perhaps planetary geologies and beyond 
 
 
 But back to the past 
 Dennett distinguishes  Darwinian creatures    Pavlovian creatures    Popperian creatures   and  Gregorian creatures  
 A simple autonomous agent say a bacterium is a Darwinian creature 
 In its simplest version the creature evolves by mutation also recombination and natural selection 
 For the moment no behavioral learning is to be considered 
 So one or a colony or an ecosystem of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us 
 
 
 At the next level up say aplysia a nervous system is present and the creature is capable of stimulus response learning á la Pavlov 
 Indeed aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimulithe later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in  expectation  of food 
 
 
 At the next level Dennett perhaps properly reserves this for us vertebrates is the Popperian creature 
 Popperian creatures in Dennetts fine phrase have  internal models  of their world and can  run the internal model  with the clutch disengaged rather than running the model in real time in the real world 
 This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our  hypotheses to die in our stead  
 I love that image 
 
 
 Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creaturenamely at least humans 
 Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives arrows digging sticks machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes 
 This enlarged shared world gives us more know how and more know that 
 Cultural evolution at some point begins to burst out of bounds 
 Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran 
 Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom 
 Chinese cooking lands in Cuba and Cuban Chinese cuisine is invented 
 Whats next under the sun 
 Who can say 
 
 
 I very much like Dennetts ladder of know how and eventual know that 
 Without invoking consciousness not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems even without evoking nerve cells 
 
 
 I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations 
 For example bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level 
 This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter 
 As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus why not envision a complex chemistry say very complex carbohydrate synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism 
 Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self sustaining web linking the carbohydrates the enzymes and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops 
 The image is not too far from how it is imagined that  idiotype  and  anti idiotype  immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen 
 In such networks for which there is modestly good evidence a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences called the  idiotype  of the first antibody 
 In turn the second  anti idiotype  antibody stimulates a third which stimulates a fourth 
 But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody hence the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space 
 It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system 
 
 
 Popperian creatures 
 Why cannot the molecular sensing and hypothesis testing churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor or not such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by 
 Are nerves necessary 
 Plants as noted are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade 
 There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified 
 Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates 
 
 
 I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures 
 Even here the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language wherever new sentences can be created is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole 
 If the conversation we recent two legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive so too is the chemical conversation in any full fledged ecosystem where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another 
 
 
 I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere with its urgent diversity in which emboldened by all our know how we do get on with a very rich conversation may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks 
 We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e mail I guess 
 Smart place a biosphere lots to talk about 
 Four billion years of yammering 
 Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago 
 
 
 Ethics
 
 
 And what of ethics 
 Does a whiff of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents 
 Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent 
 There are deep reasons for caution 
 Hume told us long ago about the  naturalistic fallacy  One cannot deduce  ought  from  is  
 From the fact that mothers care for their young we cannot deduce that they ought to do so Hume argued 
 From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so 
 
 
 Indeed Humes injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements 
 We scientists find the facts 
 You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics 
 But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is where do values come from at all 
 Humes injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category  ought  
 
 
 The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long twisted arduous 
 Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful philosophers as famous as G E Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances 
  It is wrong to kill  
 Becomes  Agggah  
 Does the positivist argument seem persuasive 
 It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists  only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful   is itself not empirically verifiable 
 One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards 
 
 
 John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all  contractually  agree to were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments 
 Thus  equality before the law  is one contract that Rawls commends to us 
  Equality before the law  is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium 
 The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue 
 
 
 I will content myself with wondering where  value  and the rudiments of  intentionality  come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts 
 Where is the place of value in a world of fact 
 
 
 So a short soliloquy 
 Facts are know that statements 
 But know how preceded know that 
 While fully aware of Humes injunction I think that from the autonomous agents perspective yuck or yum is primary unavoidable and of the deepest importance to that agent 
 I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria 
 Too much yuck this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere 
 Without attributing consciousness to an E coli or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around 
 
 
 And again without attributing consciousness once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present 
 If so another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid 
 Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible 
 You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control 
 To act ethically you must first be able to act at all 
 
 
 But what are  acts  in the first place 
 Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician 
 Now entering Harvard Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard where at age fourteen Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands 
 Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the  doings  of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent 
 Note we say the E coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner 
 But all sorts of molecular vibrational rotational and translational motions are occurring 
 What are actions and what are mere happenings 
 
 
 I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics 
 But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings Dans happy phrasing is relevant for E coli tigers us trees and autonomous agents in general 
 We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism 
 
 
 Strange and interesting is it not that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise 
 Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics intentionality value and ethics arise with autonomous agents 
 I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Humes naturalistic fallacy 
 We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents 
 
 
 
 





Zoot Suit
A style of suit worn by African Americans Filipino Americans and Mexican Americans during the s and s In Chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos of the s The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads thick soled shoes and long watch chains dangling from the belt An addition to the whole style common to Chicanos was a particular haircut long with a ducktail and a wide brimmed hat 
The word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders that later became known as the zoot suit In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison he describes the zoot  suiters style  walking slowly their shoulders swaying their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles their coats long and hip tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men In the late night jazz scenes of Harlem this style was  a killer diller coat with a drape shape reat pleats and shoulders padded like a lunatics cell Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth and the finger tipped coat was made for fun and leisure The long baggy pants were made for dancing especially the jitterbug and the wide Panama hats were another sign of adulthood  The business of fun dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by Zoot Suiters It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of free wheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture Tyler Prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit such as Cab Calloway Sammy Davis Jr and Duke Ellington Ellington performed at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in and with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits also known as Gone with the Wind suits after the style worn by Clark Gable in the movie by the same name 
Even though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities it is primarily identified with the pachucos of Los Angeles Pachucos were mostly second generation Mexicans the sons of migrant laborers and working class immigrants Pachucos created their own subculture an arrogant style of dressing a bilingual secret argot and for some individuals membership in petty criminal gangs The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zoot suiter as neither a Mexican nor an American It was not a bicultural or binational position but rather a position between cultures a  hanging in space position The overly confident slow swagger of the pachuco today exemplified by the cholo made it appear in fact as if the zoot suiter were walking on air 
During the summer of the attention of the whole country was on Los Angeles when gangs of sailors and zoot suiters battled with each other in the streets of the city It is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked beat and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zoot suiters Between the third and thirteenth of June zoot suiters were open targets Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectives 
During the late s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by Luis Valdez In a film by the same name Zoot Suit was produced and directed by Luis Valdez with performances by actors Daniel Valdez and Edward James Olmos

Zozobra
A giant forty foot effigy in the form of a puppet which is burned during the annual Santa Fe Fiesta held in Santa Fe New Mexico The word Zozobra translates to  gloom or  worry or  anguished  The Zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta which symbolizes the end of destructiveness gloom and worry setting the tone for a successful fiesta The creation of Zozobra was introduced into the fiesta in by Will Shuster who felt that the fiesta had become  dull and commercialized  Throughout the years the image of Zozobra changed from a simple twenty foot puppet to the elaborate forty foot figure with animated eyes arms and mouth that he is today In Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe He is hung on a tall pole on a hill outside the city where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happiness 
In response to the tradition of the burning of Zozobra a group of New Mexico Chicanos started a tradition of burning El Kookoóee a figure known by many Chicanos as the bogeyman during the Festival de Otoño

Deformation and river response 

Before specific examples of syntectonic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed a brief review of types of tectonic activity types of rivers and river response will be presented This background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow 

Types of deformation

The surficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms as illustrated in Figure The displacement can be seismic and associated with earthquakes and abrupt faulting or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor Faults may be lateral faults that displace or offset the channel Figure A without vertical displacement This type of displacement should be easily recognized Faults with vertical displacement may have the uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is steepened Figure B In the opposite case the gradient will be decreased Figure C The effect will resemble monoclinal tilting Figure F G Pairs of faults may produce uplifted horst or downdropped blocks graben that will both steepen and reduce gradient Figure D E This has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and synclines Figure H I 

In addition to all of these structural features the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain Figure J K L The possibilities are great but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or cross valley tilting 

Streams respond to vertical displacement along faults Figure B and C by aggradation or degradation When the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient Figure B erosion will be initiated in this reach When the displacement produces a channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream Figure C aggradation will occur Even small displacements may be sufficient to induce aggradation or degradation of large streams If the displacement forms a dam Figure C the stream will be blocked and it will flow along the fault or form a lake Wallace mentioned that even a few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream side of a fault can produce a dam across a small stream which can divert its course 

NULL

Figure Surface deformation by faulting folding and lateral tilting Plan view on left cross section on right from Ouchi small arrows indicate direction of flow Large arrows indicate direction of movement The displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated 

Horst and graben Figure D and E combine two different types of vertical displacement Figure B and C There will be aggradation upstream from the horst and degradation which will migrate upstream on the downstream part of the horst Reduced sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation Upstream of the graben there will be degradation and aggradation in the graben itself A river in such a location will be unstable as Cartier and Alt suggested for the Bitterroot River in Montana 

The type of folding Figure will affect a river similar to the various types of faulting but changes will probably be less abrupt The effects of tilting will depend upon the amount but in the simplest case steepening of a valley will cause degradation Figure K and a reverse tilt Figure L will cause deposition Lateral tilting will cause channel shift downdip Figure J or avulsion 

Figure shows only simple but exaggerated cases whereas actual displacements can be more complicated For example faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction Fault displacements of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious and its influence on alluvial rivers can be observed For example small stream channels have been offset by strike slip movement Figures A of the San Andreas fault Wallace pointed out that the offset of a stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes The main reason why channel offset caused by the San Andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault mm year Brown and Wallace and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault While fault displacements are obvious movements of the land surface by folding can be slow However this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behavior For example concentration of erosion along only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt Jefferson Nanson a Leeder and Alexander 

Types of alluvial rivers

It is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently to deformation therefore their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can be evaluated This can best be done by discussing a simple classification of alluvial channels that is based on type of sediment load and pattern 

Five basic channel patterns exist Figure straight channels with either migrating sand waves or with migrating alternate bars forming a sinuous thalweg two types of meandering channels a highly sinuous channel of equal width pattern a and channels that are wider at bends than in crossings pattern b the meandering braided transition and a typical braided stream The relative stability of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels as related to relative sediment size load velocity of flow and stream power are also indicated in Figure It has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying the gradient sediment load stream power and the type of sediment load transported by the channel Schumm and Kahn Therefore alluvial channels have also been classified according to the type of sediment load moving through the channels as suspended load mixed load and bed load channels Figure Water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel width depth meander dimensions but the relative proportions of bed load sand and gravel and suspended load silts and clays determine not only the shape of the channel but width depth ratio and channel pattern A suspended load channel has been defined as one that transports less than percent bed load and a bed load channel as one transporting more than percent bed load Schumm The mixed load channel lies between these two Figure

Figure Channel classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated variables and relative stability indicated Schumm 

Alluvial rivers that transport clay silt sand and gravel can be placed within these three general categories However within the meandering stream group there is considerable range of sinuosity to In addition in the braided stream category there are bar braided and island braided channels islands are vegetated bars 

Figure suggests that the range of channels from straight to braided forms a continuum but experimental work and field studies have indicated that the changes of pattern between braided meandering and straight occur relatively abruptly at river pattern thresholds Figure The pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power gradient and sediment load Schumm and Kahn

Figure Relation between flume slope and sinuosity during experiments at constant water discharge Sediment load stream power velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables from Schumm and Khan 

Although the five patterns of Figure involve all three river types there are five basic bed load channel patterns Figure A that have been recognized during experimental studies of channel patterns Schumm p These five basic bed load channel patterns can be extended to mixed load and suspended load channels to produce river patterns Figure Patterns   are bed load channel patterns patterns   are mixed load channel patterns and patterns   are suspended load channel patterns Figure attempts to show sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change with increasing valley slope stream power and sediment load for each channel type The three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load but within each type the different patterns reflect increased valley slope sediment load and stream power 

The different bed load channel patterns Figure can be described as follows Pattern straight essentially equal width channel with migrating sand waves Pattern alternate bar channel with migrating side or alternate bars and a slightly sinuous thalweg Pattern low sinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes Pattern transitional meandering thalweg braided channel The large alternate bars or point bars have been dissected by chutes but a meandering thalweg can be identified Pattern is a typical bar braided channel 

As compared to the bed load channels the five mixed load channels Figure B are relatively narrower and deeper and there is greater bank stability The higher degree of bank stability permits the maintenance of narrow deep straight channels Pattern and alternate bars stabilize because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels Pattern Pattern is a truly meandering channel wide on the bends relatively narrow at the crossings and subject to chute cutoffs Pattern maintains the sinuosity of a meandering channel but with a greater sediment transport the presence of bars gives it a composite sinuous braided appearance Pattern is a braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of bed load channel and it is likely to be island braided

Suspended load channels Figure C are narrow and deeper than mixed load channels Suspended load Pattern is a straight narrow deep channel With only small quantities of bed load this type of channel may have the highest sinuosity of all Patterns and 

Rivers may undergo a metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely That is a suspended load channel Pattern could become braided Pattern or a braided channel Pattern could become meandering Pattern or etc when there is a sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel Therefore the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics 

There is an additional channel pattern that spans the range of stream types of Figure This is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments Schumm et al The channel segments can be straight meandering or braided and they appear to span the range of channel types Anastomosing or anabranching channels differ from braided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by a floodplain Figure whereas braided channels have multiple thalwegs in a single channel Knighton and Nanson and Richards et al suggest that this pattern is transitioned to a single channel because anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys Smith and Smith and tectonic uplift Gregory and Schumm Reduced gradient from whatever cause appears to be important and therefore anastomosing reaches of a river can be evidence of tectonic activity 

Evidence of deformation 

The first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landforms that result from long continued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces These obvious features are in contrast to the more subtle changes of alluvial rivers 

Drainage networks

The arrangement of streams and tributaries into a drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops climate and the erodibility of the surface material Local variations in both slope and materials will cause variations in the drainage pattern Figure For example experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about percent whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes Phillips and Schumm 

NULL

Figure Map of anastomosing channels of Ovens and King Rivers Numbers indicate relative ages of channels and reaches of channels from youngest to oldest from Schumm et al 

Local variations in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage patterns A topographic high caused by active uplift will cause a deflection of portions of the drainage pattern For instance on the upslope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope This can cause portions of the drainage pattern to develop in a direction opposite to that of the drainage network An uplift may also deflect portions of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope Figure As the major streams are deflected away from the uplift tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened 

Changes of an entire drainage network as a result of tilting are described by Sparling who notes that isostatic adjustment in Ottawa County Ohio has increased the gradient of some streams and decreased the gradient of others Incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as a result of reduced gradient Russell described various drainage patterns found in the flat alluvial lands of Louisiana and he recognized a network pattern of poorly developed drainage channels that was converted to a dendritic pattern as a result of tilting and steepening of the gradient

Price and Whetstone used asymmetric river and valley cross section profiles as evidence for movement along the Chattahoochee Embayment in Florida Subsidence caused southward migration of east west flowing channels South flowing streams exhibit paired terraces while east west trending streams contain extensive terraces on the northern side with few or no terraces on the steeper southern margin Subsidence in the Chattahoochee Embayment and adjacent warping along the Chattahoochee Uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the Chattahoochee River 

Long continued tilting in a cross valley direction will cause lateral erosion and the development of an asymmetrical valley and drainage network Muehlberger noted this type of asymmetry in an area near Taos New Mexico Figure Using ⁄minute U S Geological Survey topographic

 maps he described this asymmetry quantitatively By selecting a contour on the valley wall and measuring the distance from the stream to this contour in a down tilt direction Dd and in the opposite uptilt direction Du an index of asymmetry was developed Dd Du Figure The index for small drainage basins was indicating a major displacement of the main channel in a down tilt direction Cox used a somewhat different index to demonstrate tilting and river shift in the southwestern Mississippi Embayment Other indices of asymmetry are described by Keller and Pinter pp

Lake patterns

Lakes are temporary features in terms of geological time but they can be clear evidence of deformation They occur at various scales along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time They may be isolated but they are more frequently clustered in a specific area or they are aligned along specific trends Isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses which form a dam but clustered lakes are due to regional processes which may be related to climate or paleoclimate neotectonic deformation or frequently a combination of these processes 

Large lakes may occupy geological basins and active tectonics is partly or totally involved in their formation Such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations The Bolivian Altiplano lakes Titicaca Popoo Uyuni stand at an elevation of around m and are associated with plate convergence and uplift Continental stretching and transtensional tectonics are favorable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes Often the relation of lakes to faults is obvious and a study of the lake pattern is not necessary to demonstrate the effect of tectonics See Chapter where Reelfoot Lake and the Mississippi valley sunklands are described Figures

This discussion deals with cases where specific lake patterns ria lakes and elongated lakes are related to active deformation Most of these concepts are not new For example the significance of ria lakes was identified more than years ago 

Ria Lakes 

Dendritic ria lakes occur at the lower part of a tributary which is blocked by aggradation along the trunk river Holz et al In the lower and central parts of the Amazonian Basin the formation of ria lakes is related to post glacial eustacy Irion Some of these lakes have a  knee pattern superposed on the dendritic pattern suggesting the effect of active faulting through a thick sedimentary cover Sternberg Figure

A continental rift generates tilt of the side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earths surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers For example Lake Victoria is drained by the Victoria Nile which flows north to Lake Kyoga Figure Lake Kyoga and Lake Kwania look artificial but they are not the result of dam construction They are in fact formed by uplift and eastward tilting of western Uganda Flow in the Kafu River has been reversed and water draining from Lake Victoria has found a new course to the north where it flows over Murchison Falls and into Lake Albert The geologically recent derangement of these drainage systems is the result of uplift that is apparently continuing at the present time Doornkamp and Temple

Elongated lakes 

The term elongated lakes is applied to lakes that are long and narrow These lakes are superimposed over basement structures In subsiding basins they are also closely related to active tectonics 

The Puinahua km and Punga km lakes are both located in the south part of the Marañón Basin Figure They are long and narrow and wider on the foothill side than on the craton side Punga Lake is superimposed over the structure of the Santa Elena uplift Dumont and Garcia which is interpreted as a crystalline horst surrounded by Paleozoic sedimentary strata Laurent The NE elongation of the lake is parallel to a few of the structural features mentioned by Laurent Both lakes are also parallel to the strike of normal faulting with a NNW SSE extension in the upland border Dumont et al As a result the lakes are interpreted as the surface expression of tensional stress superimposed over reactivated basement structures due to the onset of Andean tectonics Dumont and Garcia 

More precise morphological evidence of active tectonics comes from the Punga Lake According to testimony of old settlers and published travel journals Stiglish the area was covered by forest that developed on a terrace before Then the region began to subside The tree trunks of the drowned forest are still visible now below m of water during low water stages In this very flat area the water level rises about m during floods suggesting a minimum subsidence of m over about years A tectonic interpretation is favored because a local rise of base level cannot be involved Only a downward motion of the area where the lake is observed can explain the phenomenon These lakes are related to downdropped blocks that are related to a tensional system 

Terraces

The vertical warping of terraces as a result of deformation has been studied by numerous investigators Machida Zuchiewicz King and Stein The offset of terraces by lateral faulting gives a clear indication of fault movement The offset terraces at the mouth of the Waiohine Gorge in New Zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic nature of the displacement Figure In addition to river terraces the deformation of lake terraces and marine terraces Keller and Pinter are proof of isostatic and tectonic activity because they formed horizontally at a given water level An example is the isostatic deformation of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville shorelines Utah Crittenden Portions of the Lake Bonneville shorelines have been deformed as much as feet as it drained and evaporated to form Great Salt Lake In addition deformed marine terraces provide an excellent indication of recent deformation along km of the Pacific Coast of Baja California Orme Not only are terraces deformed but as an uplift is crossed a floodplain can be converted to a low terrace This will of course dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of the reach 

In addition to the obvious evidence of deformation described above evidence of deformation is provided by alluvial deposits and paleosoils Machette Keller et al Bull Rockwell et al Rockwell by variations in gradients of streams of different orders Merritts and Vincent Merritts and Hesterberg and by variations of valley and river longitudinal profiles Volkov et al Seeber and Gornitz

River response 

The clearest evidence for tectonic effects on rivers are anomalous reaches that show dramatic changes of pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes Structural geologists and petroleum geologists have known for years that rivers are strong indicators of faulting Lattman Howard 

Tectonic activity can significantly control river patterns and behavior and this is especially true of alluvial rivers Neef and Radulescu state that neotectonic movements can be reflected only in those geomorphic features that react to the smallest changes of slope such as meander characteristics In addition the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in a given valley Clearly one of the most sensitive indicators of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of a stream Bendefy et al Zuchiewicz 

Alluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change In order to maintain a constant gradient a river that is being steepened by a downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid whereas a reduction of valley slope will lead to a reduction of sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change For example Twidale reported that both the Flinders and Leichardt Rivers have changed to a braided pattern as a result of the steepening of their gradient by the Selwyn Upwarp in northern Queensland Australia and the Red River near Winnipeg Canada is straightening as a result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound Welch Other examples are provided by the Mississippi River between St Louis and Cairo and the lower Missouri River Adams as well as the Red River of the North near Winnipeg Canada Vanicek and Nagy 

Baselevel changes can also resemble the effects of active tectonics and can provide information on channel change For example if sea level is lowered and a steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift Lane argued that a lowering of baselevel will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river Indeed Lanes argument that a stream will restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baselevel change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished However sediment loads may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation Another fallacy in Lanes argument is the assumption that the valley slope and channel gradient are identical This is not the case and the two dimensional perspective leads to erroneous conclusions For example a sinuous river has a gradient less than that of the valley floor 

Sinuosity P is the ratio between channel length L c and valley length L v and it is also the ratio between valley slope S v and channel gradient S c as follows 



Therefore a straight channel has a sinuosity of and the gradient of the channel and the slope of the valley floor are the same It has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes Schumm and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the Mississippi Indus and Nile reflect the variability of the valley slope Schumm et al Jorgensen et al Schumm and Galay 

NULL

Figure Effect of a baselevel fall on channel length and pattern See text for discussion 

Figure illustrates this concept geometrically and it shows the impact of the lowering of baselevel in a valley with a stream of sinuosity P The line A C represents the channel profile and the line A B represents the profile of the valley floor Points B and C are at the river mouth and points F and G are at the same location in the valley The channel distance is one third longer than the valley distance and the difference in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream The length of the channel is times the length of the valley and therefore the stream gradient is one third less than the valley slope equation If a vertical fall of baselevel from B to D and C to E is assumed channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor If the channel is not confined laterally it can adjust to the increased valley slope F D by increasing sinuosity to and the channel profile is extended to H In this case incision ceases at point F in the valley and at point G in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from to from G to H maintains a constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope F D The one third increase of channel length sinuosity between G and H compensates for a one third steepening of the valley floor from F to D 

According to Lanes assumptions the effect of this baselevel fall would be propagated upstream to point A where an amount of erosion equal to B D would occur However because the stream can adjust the steepening of the valley floor will not result in a change of stream gradient Rather the channel lengthens and the effect of baselevel lowering is propagated only a relatively short distance upstream The distance will undoubtedly depend on local conditions and the original slope of the valley floor but this exercise supports Sauciers contention that Pleistocene sea level change in the lower Mississippi valley was effective only as far as Baton Rouge see also Blum and Blum and Valastro The probability that a large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baselevel changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly unlike during the experimental studies The river therefore has more time to adjust by changing sinuosity 

Further evidence for the type of channel response shown in Figure is demonstrated by the experimental studies of Jeff Ware oral comm He lowered baselevel relatively slowly to a maximum of cm in a flume with a total length of m This change would have doubled the channel gradient However the effect of the baselevel lowering extended only m upstream and the change in baselevel was accommodated by an increase of sinuosity from to in the lower m in the flume It is clear however that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of baselevel This channel widened and roughness increased thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the baselevel change 

Wares experiments showed that a sinuosity increase which resulted in a slope decrease was only part of the adjustment and width depth and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power Therefore channel pattern change may only absorb part of a valley slope or baselevel change The River Nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing as valley slope changes Schumm and Galay 

Changes of valley floor gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern variations but variations of valley floor slope can be the result of several influences Tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern Adams In addition a high sediment transporting tributary may build a fan like deposit in the valley which will persist even after the tributary sediment load has decreased When the main river crosses this fan pattern changes will result as the river attempts to maintain a constant gradient Tributaries to the Jordan River in Israel have developed fan like deposits in the valley and the valley floor of the Jordan Valley undulates as a result The Jordan River as it approaches one of these convexities straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops a more sinuous course on the steeper downstream side of the fan Schumm p 

It is important to realize that channels that lie near a pattern threshold Figure may change their characteristics dramatically with only a slight change in the controlling variable For example some rivers that are meandering and that are near pattern thresholds become braided with only a small addition of bed load Schumm Experimental studies and field observations confirm that a change of valley floor slope will cause a change of channel morphology The change will differ however depending where the channel lies on a plot such as that of Figure and depending on the type of channel Figure For example with increasing slope a straight channel will become sinuous a low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous and a meandering channel will braid With decreasing slope a braided channel will meander and a meandering channel will straighten

Figure Reaches of degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting 

Although pattern changes may dominate river response deposition in reaches of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in reaches of steepened gradient Figure In fact upstream deposition will reduce downstream sediment loads thereby increasing the tendency for downstream erosion Therefore in addition to the primary valley floor deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation there are third order effects beyond the area of deformation For example deposition upstream from the axis of a dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation Figure This means that the uplift is acting as a dam and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift produces sufficient sediment to compensate erosion will occur downstream beyond the limits of deformation However it is more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion on the steeper downstream reach and when this increased load moves downstream aggradation will result Figure 

NULL

Figure Effect of change from weaker W to more resistant R materials on meander pattern 

Another aspect of both active and neotectonics is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades Resistant alluvium clay plugs gravel armor or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shift and bank erosion The result should be deformed or compressed meanders upstream and a change of meander character at the contact For example as meanders shift downvalley their movement may be retarded if more resistant alluvium or bedrock is encountered Jin and Schumm Hence a fault may present a barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed Figure A similar pattern will result if the river encounters bedrock as it crosses an upwarp or if as a result of incision it encounters resistant materials in a portion of its course Yeromenko and Ivanov reviewed the Russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts the largest number of meanders occur upstream of the structures which supports Gardners observations of bedrock channels in the Colorado Plateau This is the reverse of what is expected for alluvial channels from the relation of Figure Therefore an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone 

Discussion

Alluvium is usually assumed to hide the underlying geology but rates of active tectonic movement are sufficiently rapid to affect the morphology and behavior of alluvial rivers Rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even slow aseismic tectonic activity For example evidence of active tectonics is as follows 


	 
	deformation of valley floor longitudinal profile
	 
	deformation of channel longitudinal profile
	 
	change of channel pattern 
	 
	change of channel width and depth
	 
	conversion of floodplain to a low terrace
	 
	reaches of active channel incision or lateral shift 
	 
	effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation degradation aggradation flooding bank erosion 
	 
	formation of lakes 


Alluvial channels are sensitive indicators of change but they also adjust to changes of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics Therefore it may be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when in fact human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time Pattern change alone is not sufficient evidence for active tectonics rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence and or surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation In many areas the evidence will be circumstantial Nevertheless anomalous reaches that are not related to artificial controls tributary influences lithologic change or paleotectonics may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise 

Lakes can also provide information on subsidence and ria lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences For example during Pleistocene aggradation in the Ohio River and Mississippi River valleys numerous lakes formed in tributary valleys Therefore care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies 








 The future of boundaryless careers



When massive economic restructuring forced William H Whyte Jrs organization man to walk permanently out of the front doors of the corporation many of the assumptions of a traditional career path followed shortly behind In the wake of his departure people were left pondering how they would survive without a job for life a corporate road map to guide their destiny and the firms hierarchy to define their status or place in society Without employers orderly structures external guides for action and linear career paths however just what is the future of career  When the career devolves to the level of the individual does free agency prevail and a form of career anarchy result  Is there anything that can be concluded about careers if everyone seems to be doing their own thing  

We argue here that the answer is an emphatic yes The new environment suggests a shift from pre ordained and linear development to perpetually changing career paths and possibilities As a result a shift from bounded careers   prescribed by relatively stable organisational and occupational structures   to boundaryless careers   where uncertainty and flexibility are the order of the day   is increasingly common The concept of the boundaryless career is broadly based and intended to reflect the emergent pace of economic change It does not characterise any single career form but rather a range of possible forms that defy traditional employment assumptions Arthur Rousseau p 

The myriad interactions of a boundaryless career over a lifetime of work experiences can appear overwhelming A complex web of relationships emerges from numerous exchanges among individuals teams and employers The interplay may seem downright chaotic So much so that one may be tempted to think that no aggregates can be drawn from this seemingly random micro level behaviour Yet despite the large amount of publicity generated as organization man was shown to the door a large proportion of people who participate in the work place and even whole industries never really played by the traditional rules anyway For these people and industries the boundaryless career is simply business as usual It is business to which we can turn to understand better the future of career or   as we see the future   the boundaryless career 

We focus in this chapter on situations where boundaryless career practices appear to be well established and fruitful involving industries where open labour markets have thrived Our examination suggests that seemingly random micro level activities result in the creation of emergent pattern and order Further examination reveals not only order but remarkable stability In the absence of external guides people selforganise to learn and make sense of their environments Moreover the resulting social interdependence provides a new form of cohesiveness that in turn introduces new structure Micro level activities gather the force and the power to shape macro level processes and larger institutions It is organising rather than organisation that is the catch word of the boundaryless career 

In this chapter we set out to explore the pervasive nature of boundaryless careers We present a theoretical perspective through which we can understand the dynamics of boundaryless careers followed by descriptive analysis demonstrating evidence of theory in practice in two selected industries First we present relevant aspects of Karl Weicks work and and discuss the process of enactment We then examine the industry cases We conclude by refining the arguments by noting key behavioural aspects of enactment and other considerations of the process 

An enactment perspective 

Our exploration in this chapter is framed in the social psychological perspective of Karl Weick Weicks work provides a theoretical lens for explaining the processes at work in boundaryless career behaviour His conception of enactment directly related to his previous work on sensemaking explains the dynamics of the characteristic interdependence that operates in boundaryless careers The enactment view emphasises that action creates the environment That is people create situations and understandings out of their own dispositions and backgrounds A simple analogy is with the legal system People enact laws which become part of the legal system which in turn influences further behaviour leading people to enact new laws and so on A legal system continually evolves from the enactment of individual laws Similarly career systems evolve from the enactment of individual careers 

Another way to engage with enactment is to relate it to the process of natural selection According to Weick careers unfold through successive cycles of enactment selection and retention whereby the enactment of careers gives rise to broader organising of work arrangements From this standpoint the basic theme for the entire organizing model is found in the following recipe for sensemaking How can I know what I think until I see what I say  Weick p In the simplest form of the recipe enactment is saying action selection is seeing what I say perception and retention is knowing what I think sensemaking 

If enactment is saying then it is in essence the action of individuals in their environment that starts the process When someone takes action or interacts with their environment it immediately impacts others and hence the individual produces part of their environment For example if you believe a certain group of individuals to be hostile when you interact with them your behaviour may reflect your fear In response they may sense that fear and behave in a hostile manner The environment becomes hostile Moreover you have contributed to enacting that hostile environment The result is a circular self reinforcing relationship resembling a self fulfilling prophecy An alternative perhaps more satisfactory circular relationship could result if instead of fear you initially showed confidence 

How do we relate this process to boundaryless careers  For this it is important to understand that there is less room for personal inputs manoeuvring or enactment if there are clear salient rules and structures defining behaviour In traditional bounded organisations and careers the proliferation of structure hierarchy plans detailed job descriptions prescribed relationships and established road maps provide an armoury of articulated rules and social cues to guide behaviour The situation is strong Mischel in as much as it provides little scope for improvisation 

In the pure form of the boundaryless career however such explicit guides do not exist Instead of providing clear guidelines employment situations are characterised by ambiguity Weak situations fall short of providing sufficient incentives for consistent behaviour or even similar expectations for those operating within them Mischel In weak situations individuals are not able to interpret events in the same way and the resulting ambiguity opens the door to myriad personal interpretations and opportunities for enactment People engage in a stable process of trial and error that resembles an evolutionary system Weick People join together in shared improvisation that begins to form new codes and structures to guide their further behaviour In the process microstrength shapes macroweaknesses Weick p through the unfolding of boundaryless careers 

To illustrate the preceding argument we will apply Weicks ideas to descriptions provided by AnnaLee Saxenian on the dynamics of the Silicon Valley and by Candace Jones on the independent film industry We reinterpret the contributions of these authors by explicitly re framing them within Weicks framework and we emphasise it is these three authors and their original descriptions and ideas that deserve the major part of the credit for this chapter 

To show how enactment and associated principles of self organising and learning come to life we will trace the process of enactment in each setting First we will describe the factors that have contributed to boundaryless career forms in each example Next we will cite some of the characteristics that make the resulting circumstances weak After that we will discuss the social behaviour and collective actions that fill the resulting void in the environment Finally we will point out the patterns order and shape we see enactment bringing to each of these respective settings By doing so we hope to convey the pervasive qualities of both the process of enactment and the vehicle through which it operates   the boundaryless career 

The Silicon Valley 

The Silicon Valley is notorious for the individual and collective success of its firms So much so that the name Silicon Valley has come to be synonymous with the electronics industry The region is regarded as the centre for excellence and innovation and has given rise to some of the worlds most influential firms including Apple Hewlett Packard and Intel Since its inception the Valley has operated with an individualistic open labour market Today the learning advantages that emanate from associated boundaryless career behaviour are regarded as a key source of competitive advantage for the region Saxenian One can argue that the Valleys boundarylessness is a necessary feature of operating in a dynamic industry that demands constant innovation Proponents point out that in order to learn and solve the problems encountered in rapid technological advancement knowledge must be shared among firms in a symbiotic balance between co operation and competition Boundaryless characteristics appear more prominently when an industry is knowledge   rather than capital intensive or when firms operate in economic clusters 

However other industry clusters and several notable large electronics firms do not engage with boundaryless practices We may therefore attribute the boundaryless features of the Silicon Valley to its heritage Some believe this is in part due to the location of the region hosting a West Coast Northern Californian alternative in geographical isolation from the established East Coast industry The greenfield site had an empty slate and no institutional rules Others like the late William Hewlett a key and highly influential founder of the region believe that success stemmed from the learning advantages of an open labour market Hewlett routinely offered the following advice If you want to succeed here you need to be willing to do three things change jobs often talk to your competitors and take risks   even if it means failing Saxenian p Hewlett was himself influenced by his Stanford Dean of Engineering William Terman a mentor and an influential Hewlett Packard board member Collins Porras Today Hewletts and Termans philosophy permeates the region Despite fierce inter firm competition open information exchange is common practice among the regions producers 

Several features of the Valley contribute to creating a weak environment The high pace of technology and product life cycles fluidity of firm formation and failure rapid employee turnover resulting in little com pany specific socialisation as well as a lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy all contribute to an environment in which individuals rely on alternative cues to guide their behaviour For example in the Valley technology moves quickly and competition is tough New firms form almost overnight  and many disappear just as quickly When firms come and go like ships in the night it is not surprising that employees tend to identify with their profession not their company Moreover peoples loyalty is not only to their profession but to the host industry region As one local semiconductor executive reportedly noted Many of us wake up in the morning thinking that we work for Silicon Valley Inc Saxenian p They view job changing as the norm 

Average job tenure is in the area of two years and annual turnover is around and often higher for smaller firms Saxenian As one engineer explained two or three years is about the max at a job for the Valley because theres always something more interesting across the street Saxenian p Knowledge and practices cross company borders at a pace that defies the embedding of routines within the boundaries of any single company and instead favours inter company exchange Everyone knows that upon leaving a company they may well work together again in the future A colleague might become a customer or a competitor todays boss could be tomorrows subordinate Saxenian p Institutionally based hierarchy therefore loses its saliency In the Valley respect and authority are gained through competence technical excellence and market share with the highest regard accorded to successful entrepreneurs 

In the context of this weak environment clear social behaviour emerges as structure gets built at the micro level People seek to form relationships and routines in order to learn and thrive in their surroundings In the Valley information is the life blood of the industry and continuous learning through relationships is the key to a successful career People build their own competence by active membership in the larger learning community Learning takes place in the pub or club In the Valleys early days it used to take place in the infamous Wagon Wheel Bar and the Homebrew Computer Club Now it takes place in one of many watering holes or hobby groups where the Valleys high technology workers regularly meet for lunch or after work In these meeting places people gather to see old friends gossip and make new acquaintances In the workers adopted social settings the transition from friendly chatter to serious business occurs naturally 

In the Silicon Valley collective actions unfold through a combination of mutual interests intellectual curiosity and problem solving geared towards developing new markets technologies products or applications for computers Workers have a systemic commitment to technical excellence in their field As one engineer explained the process is quite simple people rub shoulders and share ideas Saxenian p The knowledge of these informal groups is so powerful that many local entrepreneurs came to see social relationships and even gossip as crucial aspects of their business Saxenian p As one local manager claimed Over a lunch conversation or a beer youll learn that company A or company B has a technology you want If it fits your needs youll build it into your next product Saxenian p In this manner micro level conversations influence the creation of new technologies products and applications 

It is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how patterns and order emerge in the Valley In the absence of hierarchy and centralised planning employees in the Valley rely on their skills rather than on formal position to provide a reference point for their careers Such self generated guides are reinforced by professional social networks which provide a tacit road map about who knows who and who does what in the industry These networks serve as efficient job search networks and makeshift recruitment centres As one engineer reported You don’t just hire people out of the blue In general its people you know or you know someone who knows them Saxenian p Social networks impose structure on larger and looser situations It is the region and its relationships rather than the firm that define opportunities for individual and collective advances in Silicon Valley Saxenian 

Thus while Silicon Valleys high rates of job mobility and new firm formation lead to local losses for individual firms they also foster a dynamic process of adaptation that spurs the evolution of the region Knowledge of the latest techniques in design production and marketing is diffused rapidly throughout the area The result is an exceptional rate of technical and organisational innovation created by a complex mix of social solidarity and individualistic competition Saxenian p The resilience of Silicon Valleys economy shows that an unpredictable open labour market and seemingly chaotic career paths and relationships have led to macro economic stability for the region and hence continued opportunity for the community at large Ironically many of these Silicon Valley job hoppers may well have led more stable lives than the upwardly mobile organizational men of the s who were transferred from place to place by the same employer Saxenian p 

The independent film making industry 

Like the Silicon Valley the independent film making industry is noted for its innovative ability cutting edge creativity and overall economic success Like in the Silicon Valley boundaryless careers are central to independent film making activities These activities evolved in the wake of fierce competition posed by the proliferation of television and the need to cut fixed costs They superseded the former studio based model of in house film production and its associated restrictive practices Since the early s the new model has persisted Boundaryless careers provide the building blocks that combine to facilitate production of the industrys separately creative parts Independent film production has thrived as a superior organising model to its in house predecessor Jones 

Several characteristics of the independent film industry favour boundarylessness including the uncertainty in the marketplace the limited project duration the lack of vertical integration among industry players and the excess supply of quality labour The uncertainty of the market stems from the fact that production of any particular film revolves around whether or not sufficient financing is obtained to start and ultimately complete production of any given film When financing is arranged it is specifically for the purpose of completing a single project the making of the film The limited duration of the project is such that all resources including human resources are temporary The assembled company is essentially wound down upon the films release At this time the films credits symbolise that those who made it have moved on to other assignments 

Uncertainty over financing and limited project duration foster a weak environment in which permanent structure is dysfunctional Studios combine with subcontractors for specific film projects and disband when the work is done Moreover the project based system allows for highly complex unique products   films   to benefit from rapid and efficient allocation and re allocation of resources Each time a film is completed the whole process starts over again and employment relationships are re negotiated A ready supply of quality labour contributes to the success of the independent production model The industry is a magnet for talented committed workers eager for work on the industrys terms These include being ready to depart to remote locations at a moments notice However as with Silicon Valley high technology projects much of the work is economically clustered thereby facilitating fluidity of movement from one challenge to another 

As Joness research affirms peoples social behaviour reveals that several distinct stages can be observed over the course of a career in the film industry At the beginning stage freelance employees are constantly vying to participate in an industry in which there are no clear rules for entry As one grip electrician explained Theres no tried and true way to get started You have to find people you like who make movies Its getting the first job that is the hardest Jones p Once inside the worker at the crafting stage finds that You build your reputation every day you’re only as good as your last job pp   Reputation matters as careers are self managed and advanced through successive credits that span multiple largely forgotten temporary film making companies 

Having learned key skills and become indoctrinated into the industry culture individuals enter a navigating stage furthering their reputation and developing the personal contacts that provide the resources to navigate from one project to another In the words of one film commissioner We are a big industry but a small industry because we talk to one another Jones p It is through talking to each other that people gain access to experiences that both hone existing abilities and cultivate more complex skills Eventually successful careers go full circle and move to a maintenance stage Here senior members of the industry identify and train new members establish workshops that develop talent in the field and co ordinate events such as film festivals During this period people address personal needs which may have been neglected during earlier career stages because of the necessity to survive in a relatively unforgiving industry 

In a weak environment that lasts a lifetime it is critical that non bureaucratic forms of cohesion bring order to the industry Part of this cohesion is provided by subcontractors whose processes of selection training and socialisation bring boundaryless careers together in project based arrangements that provide tacit infrastructure and social familiarity However it is at the level of the individual career that we can most clearly see the micro level behaviour that fills the relatively structure less context Despite the fact that no explicit rules or operating procedures exist there is much tacit communication that binds professionals together The aggregate effects of individuals acting independently leads to macro level cohesion Shared understanding and related expectations for example regarding the need for unusual working hours and the use of idle time to teach newcomers professional skills play a key role linking identities to workplace interactions In the process of learning the ropes individuals are socialised and begin to make key contacts that help progress them to the next stages of their career Once socialised people engage in collective learning as they problem solve on a project by project basis Learning accumulates disperses and evolves as industry specialists enact their working environment 

From micro level enactment we see macro level influence and patterns order and shape in the independent film industry Not only do we observe distinct stages of careers we see aggregate social norms influencing behaviour What one can see from the pattern of progression that characterises freelance boundaryless careers in the film industry is that although few formal boundaries exist persistent social structures and repeated patterns of interaction can be observed In the process of enacting their careers individuals engage in reinforcing the cohesive social patterns of the industry which serve to guide the stages of their development In this respect careers in the Silicon Valley and the film industry have much in common with organising in film making resembling a project based Valley Just as careers can be traced in the Valley through the development of technology and tightly knit project teams in film a clear pattern also emerges that reveals micro level organising shaping macro activity 

Refinements on enactment 

Agency and communion

Both of our previous examples suggest that the enactment of boundaryless careers unfolds through a mixture of personal initiative and mutual co operation Marshall after Bakan refers to the elements in this mixture as agency and communion At a very basic level agency is about control and communion is about co operation Agency is individualistic and characterised by autonomy independence initiative and adaptation It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people are ultimately responsible for their own development Communion in contrast to agency is concerned about connections relationships tolerance and trust It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people need to manage their own arrangements for working with others 

In weak environments in which rules are not defined and behavioural responses not controlled both agency and communion are means by which people respond to uncertainty Agency provides direction and drive to career behaviour and helps to diffuse ambiguity by providing vision and long term goals Left to its own means however agency may cause strong hierarchies to reform the balance of power to be lost and most importantly the trust and co operation necessary for people and information to move across boundaries to be forfeited Communion provides the platform for mutual support and collective learning through which shared visions may be pursued However unbridled communion may neglect to attend to the mechanisms and rewards through which effective collaboration can occur 

The Silicon Valley and independent film making examples illustrate the interplay of agency and communion Agency occurs through the individual initiative and enthusiasm people bring to their careers within their adopted industries communion occurs through the collaborative ways of working that substitute for more formal arrangements Together the combination of behaviours supports current high technology or film making projects while it simultaneously develops people for further opportunities This development includes community building that will influence the make up and effectiveness of future project teams Host industries will thrive our examples suggest as long as agency and communion are allowed to work in tandem Rousseau Arthur 

Contemporary views of work frequently lament a loss of community in restructured employment arrangements However in calling for a return to community these views frequently look no further than the single company An enactment perspective suggests that communities can be much more broadly diffused Both the Silicon Valley and film making stories demonstrate that host industries as well as their embedded occupations provide alternative contexts for community building to occur Other kinds of community   stemming for example from shared ideological family educational ethnic or gender attachments   can also provide enduring support for peoples boundaryless career endeavours Parker Arthur 

 	Some researchers notably Marshall emphasise the feminine characteristics of communion versus the masculine characteristics of agency We do not do so here although it may be interesting to contemplate whether the Silicon Valley is in the broadest sense feminised 

Reciprocity

A related concept is that of reciprocity Since workers cannot be all things to all people all of the time a balance of behaviours is required Reciprocity refers to the connection between what people give to and what people take from their employment situations Traditional career models used to prescribe that people offer loyalty in return for deferred rewards Accordingly deferred pension rights vacation time promotion opportunities and social acceptance were most reserved for those who had served their time In contrast those who changed employer were handicapped by the loss of the privileges that they left behind The Silicon Valley and film making worlds suggest a different logic one where the old entitlement based models are a hindrance to boundaryless career investments 

With boundaryless careers employment relationships are too fluid to assume the trappings of traditional loyalty based employment systems In the simplest case employment arrangements reflect a spot contract involving a simple exchange of work for immediate financial payment However our examples suggest subtler forces are at work People are recruited to participate in high technology and film making projects for the skills that they bring   skills that have been developed from previous projects The system at its best consists of cycles in which the learning taken from previous projects is applied in the current project which in turn provides new learning opportunities The simple exchange of commitment to do ones best in return for learning opportunities may be a common one in contemporary employment and one that inspires many workers to seek new employment pastures when their learning slows down Arthur Inkson Pringle 

The concept of reciprocity reinforces the significance of project based activities Work which provides an underlying project based structure such as in construction jobs law cases or computing programmes provides a particular time span for reciprocities to occur If the benefits are genuinely mutual projects provide a basis for high commitment from both parties to the short term employment contract Yet the benefits of reciprocity can accrue beyond the projects conclusion Individuals can take their learning from projects and project participants with them Meanwhile their influence on other project participants can be retained in the sponsoring company or the host industry or both Ultimately other industries can also benefit as mobile workers transport best practices to new situations 

A new continuity 

What general lessons can be claimed from our two examples  Many would argue that traditional employment systems going back to the factories of the eighteenth century do not favour boundaryless careers We agree but we also live in a time when those systems are failing and where their underlying assumptions of stasis are incompatible with the emergent reality of persistent change Moreover those systems were designed according to a conception of labour capital rather than to one of intellectual capital Yet it is the conception of intellectual capital that is increasingly emphasised today Readers of this chapter will most likely see themselves as having a capacity for continuous learning Is it really too great a step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the workforce at large  

If the workforce at large can learn what are the social arrangements that best sustain new learning  Leaving the determination of what is to be learned to a few senior managers  Knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know or at least contribute to knowing what is best for themselves  Having people trapped by deferred rewards Williamson or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust  

A colleague recently visited the Czech republic and explored that countrys relatively rapid adjustment to a market economy She asked what was the single best thing a Czech worker could do to learn the underlying principles of the market Work for McDonalds went the surprising reply but only for six months It was explained that six months was quite long enough for the uninitiated worker to appreciate the importance of customers and customer service After six months the worker had learned what he or she could and it was time from a career perspective to move on 

The contrast between working for McDonalds for six months or working for McDonalds for a lifetime is writ large the contrast between boundaryless careers and their traditional bounded counterparts Todays work is increasingly intelligent work Quinn that calls on workers learning capacities and   as our examples suggest   provides an organising structure rich in project opportunities through which learning episodes can unfold If that organising structure is lacking the worker can heed the advice of our Czech informant and design a project for herself or himself 

In the future we submit most careers will be boundaryless We have sought to illustrate the future by exploring two industries where boundaryless careers have flourished   reaping benefits for people companies and host industries alike New theories such as Karl Weicks theory on the enactment of careers can help us to understand the underlying patterns and dynamics inherent in complex self organising social phenomena People may not need to move between firms perpetually but they will need to take charge of their own learning agendas As they take charge boundaries will form and re form and underlying order provide a macro economic stability in an environment in which organization man has become all but extinct

When an architectural competition was announced for the New York Public Library on May Dr John Shaw Billings the librarys executive director was determined that in his building design would not triumph over function He had in mind Bostons newly built public library a beautiful but in his opinion poorly functioning building Billings an ex army physician was responsible for organizing the Surgeon Generals Library and a celebrated medical index He was also an expert in hospital design and was thus familiar with building construction He drafted a plan for the new library whose most unorthodox feature was the location of the main reading room It was not located near the main entrance as was common practice but on an upper floor above the book stacks 
The terms of the architectural competition were strict and included detailed floor plans that the competitors were required to follow There were two stages intended to attract new talent as well as established firms First six architects were chosen from an open competition These six then advanced to a second stage where they competed against six invited firms that included not only McKim Mead White the architects of the Boston Public Library but also such luminaries as Peabody Stearns George B Post and an up and coming young firm Carrère Hastings The up and comers carried the day McKim much to his chagrin not only lost but placed third behind Howard Cauldwell It was his own fault since he imperiously ignored the suggested plan and substituted his own arrangement Carrère Hastings conscientiously followed Billings requirements 
The projected budget for the new library was not large million and Billings expected a relatively modest building That was not what he got All three designs were monumental Carrère Hastings and Howard Cauldwell used the Modern French style which was more ornate and allowed for more articulation to the façade than the austere Classical style that McKim opted for All incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floors Corinthian in McKims case Ionic in the other two the completed building is Corinthian The compositional strategies were roughly similar a monumental stair led to an elevated main floor the entrance was placed in the center more understated in McKims elegant design statuary and urns adorned the attic All three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence dignity and of culture rooted in the past 
I mentioned the New York Public Library competition when I gave a public lecture in connection with a recent architectural competition for the new Salt Lake City Public Library The library board had conducted a national search for an architect visited new libraries across the country and solicited proposals from prominent architects They had narrowed their list to four firms Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel are respected New York architects with a long record of university buildings and museums including a new library of science industry and business for the New York Public Library system Moshe Safdie had built major civic buildings in Israel Canada and the United States and recently completed the public library in Vancouver British Columbia Moore Ruble Yudell is a Los Angeles firm founded by the late Charles Moore with whom John Ruble and Buzz Yudell built several university libraries and a public library in Berlin Will Bruder the least well known of the four is a southwesterner and the architect of the new well regarded Phoenix Public Library 
I told my audience that I thought that the Salt Lake City library board would have a more difficult choice than their nineteenth century New York counterparts It was not a question of function The Salt Lake City librarians had prepared an equally exhaustive program of requirements so whichever architect was chosen commodity probably would be well served As for firmness I was reasonably sure that any of these experienced firms would build soundly It was the consideration of delight that would make the selection harder Gwathmey and Siegel design crisply detailed understated buildings in a latter day version of the International Style Safdie too is a modernist but he follows in the footsteps of Pei and his buildings are frankly monumental the Vancouver library had been likened to the Roman Coliseum Moore Ruble Yudells work is different Informal and animated their eclectic Postmodern designs are likely to include ornament and architectural motifs drawn from their surroundings Bruder on the other hand designs chic buildings that incorporate exposed structural elements rough industrial materials and sleek details Building on the same site fulfilling the same functional requirements and using the same up to date construction technology the four firms would produce libraries that would look different 
The library board awarded the commission to Moshe Safdie and a year later the plans for the new building were unveiled The new library will feature an unusual triangular shaped main building and a curving wall like structure that encloses a public square A hundred years ago it was taken for granted that the New York Public Library would be designed in some variant of the Classical style Today a public library can take many guises It can be relentlessly avant garde like the new billion national library in Paris where the books are housed in four L shaped  story glass towers and the readers are lodged in underground rooms which the London Times described as  a series of rectangular salons identical of course where you can admire the ultra smooth gray concrete steel grille ceilings and the expanses of African veneer  A new library can be comfortably Modernist like the new British Library in London which the Independent humorously described as  a giant municipal building that has made its way from Scandinavia having crashed headfirst through an English brickworks on the way  Tom Beebys handsome Harold T Washington Library in Chicago on the other hand is distinctly old fashioned with rusticated stone walls and carved brick ornaments that are a literal evocation of the citys nineteenth century architectural tradition Instead of trendy plastic or metal chairs the reading areas are equipped with solid wood tables and traditional courthouse chairs James Ingo Freeds Main Public Library in San Francisco on the other hand is both old and new the imposing granite and stainless steel exterior is more or less Classical on one façade and more or less Modernist on another 
The coexistence of different architectural styles is nothing new In a essay titled  Style in American Architecture  Ralph Adams Cram identified no less than seven contemporary styles although he called them  tendencies  Five were traditional McKims pure Classicism the Beaux Arts French Modern Colonial which was associated with houses but was also appearing in larger buildings such as the Johns Hopkins University campus Crams own High Gothic and a looser interpretation of the medieval style as practiced by his partner Goodhue Two were new steel frame construction which Cram described as an enfant terrible and what he called the Secessionists Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago the Greene brothers in Pasadena who exhibited  a strongly developed enmity to archaeological forms of any kind  Cram was not sanguine about the future but he nevertheless concluded  Chaos then confronts us in that there is no single architectural following but legion and in that fact lies the honor of our art for neither is society one or ever at one with itself  
Cram is right most historical periods are marked by stylistic confusion it is stylistic consensus that is unusual There was such a brief consensus in the late s when both architects and the American public under the influence of the immensely popular Worlds Columbian Exposition embraced Classicism at least for public buildings That unanimity lasted long enough for the New York Public Library competition but it began to unravel shortly after as Crams essay makes clear There was also a consensus in the s at least among progressive architects That consensus did not last either After Mies van der Rohe gave up the free flowing plans and asymmetrical massing that had characterized the Barcelona Pavilion and the Tugendhat House and began designing buildings whose details and materials were Modern but whose layout and composition were distinctly Classical In the s Le Corbusier proclaimed the  Five Points of a New Architecture the building raised on stilts the roof garden the frame structure that allowed a free plan the free façade and the horizontal ribbon window He too had second thoughts Thirty years later his wonderful chapel at Ronchamps had massive sculpted wall that concealed a concrete frame the roof far from being flat resembled a billowing nuns coif Le Corbusier who had coined the famous expression  a house is a machine for living in  now adopted distinctly un machinelike building materials such as crudely finished concrete exposed brick roughened stucco and fieldstone This volte face gave rise to the so called Brutalist style which had a worldwide influence shaping the work of architects as dissimilar as James Stirling and Paul Rudolph and ultimately opening the door to Postmodern stylistic experiments such as Charles Moores little house in the Berkeley hills 
The inconstancy of the International Style practitioners should have been expected The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules only to bend and break them Even Classicism which appears at first glance to be highly regimented is not immune As far as we know the ancient Greeks used only three orders Doric Ionic and Corinthian Vitruvius describes them and also refers to a Tuscan order which is a Roman invention Roman too is the so called Composite order an ornate blend of Ionic and Corinthian The vault the arch and the dome unknown to the Greeks were other Roman additions to the Classic canon Architects have been stretching Classical rules ever since breaking pediments flattening pilasters magnifying and shrinking columns rusticating masonry A sixteenth century French architect Philibert de lOrme invented a French order Edwin Lutyens devised an order based on Mughal precedents for the Viceroys House in New Delhi more recently Allan Greenberg created an order for the offices of the Secretary of State that incorporated the Great Seal of the United States Michael Graves designed Classical caryatids columns carved in the shape of human figures to support the pedimented front of an office building for the Walt Disney Company in Burbank While the supports of the porch of the Erechtheon in Athens take the form of graceful maidens Graves caryatids are the Seven Dwarfs 
The headquarters of a company whose logo is a pair of mouse ears obviously demands a different decorum from a temple In the past religious buildings and palaces required a narrow stylistic range As architectural commissions grew to include civic and commercial buildings warehouses factories shops and cinemas houses and weekend houses every sort of building a single style no longer sufficed Gothic is an evocative style for churches but despite Walpoles efforts it is ill adapted to houses Romanesque makes imposing city halls but is too heavy to be applied to skyscrapers The International Style makes striking small buildings but monotonous large ones Shingle Style cottages are pleasing a Shingle Style Home Depot is ridiculous As Cram wisely observed  Architecture is nothing unless it is intimately expressive and if utterly different things clamor for voicing different also must be their architectural manifestation  
The great architects Brunelleschi Palladio Wren Richardson Lutyens regularly looked to the past for inspiration In Richard Meier built the Smith House which has been called the first International Style revival building Like all revivalists Meier picks and chooses At first glance the Smith House has all the stylistic hallmarks of a Le Corbusier villa of the s a free plan flat roof white walls pipe railings horizontal ribbon windows a ramp Yet it is built out of wood and steel not masonry The white walls are painted wood siding not stucco the details are more refined the plate glass sheets are larger the structure lighter The result is an International Style that is filtered through American consciousness and shaped by American technology It is like Thomas Jefferson building Classical columns out of wood the same but different 
Although art historians use terms like Gothic Revival and Greek Revival to distinguish later reincarnations of styles architects look at history differently  For the serious architect the past exists not as a legacy to be possessed through a self conscious act of the modern will  writes Roger Scruton in The Aesthetics of Architecture  but as an enduring fact an ineliminable part of an extended present  That is why architects whether they are Inigo Jones or Louis Kahn make architectural pilgrimages to the Mediterranean roots of Western architecture Sketchbook in hand they plumb the secrets of the master builders of the past Consciousness of the past may also explain why architects tend to resist being categorized according to style they instinctively understand that the history of architecture including the present is a continuity rather than a series of episodes 
Stylistic consistency is much admired today but it was not always so In Filippo Brunelleschi began the Foundling Hospital in Florence whose delicate arcade of Corinthian columns surmounted by pedimented windows is generally considered the first building of the Renaissance At the very same time he was building a great dome over the crossing of the cathedral of Florence in a style that was not Classical but distinctly Gothic pointed arches and all The German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel is best known for his severe Classical public buildings such as the superb Altes Museum in Berlin but he also worked in other styles Gothic in churches and picturesque Italianate in villas McKim Mead White favored the Classical style for public buildings and palatial residences but built Norman parish churches Shingle Style summer retreats French Renaissance mansions and American Colonial country houses John Russell Pope an eclectic master designed beautiful picturesque Tudor Georgian and Colonial country estates Edwin Lutyens was another Classicist whose residential work was eclectic 
Domestic architects had to be adaptable because house styles changed according to fashion In the United States Tudor was popular in the s as was the Free Style Cotswold and French Provincial appeared in the s After the s influenced by the restoration of Williamsburg American Colonial returned to favor The Cotswold style with its relatively severe details and blunt forms created a very different setting from French Provincial which tended to have more delicate details from Free Style with its almost rustic atmosphere or from sturdy Colonial Since historic styles carry cultural overtones using different styles was also a way for architects and clients to say different things 
If architectural style is a language an analogy that is deeply flawed it is closer to slang than to grammatical prose Architectural styles are mutable unregulated improvised Architects break the rules and invent new ones In part this is simply the irrepressible urge of creative individuals In part architects break stylistic rules because they can After all most of the rules that govern building design fire codes building codes zoning laws budgets programmatic requirements engineering norms are outside the architects control stylistic rules are firmly within his purview Since architecture is so intensely competitive doing something unexpected unusual or just different is a way to be noticed to rise above the crowd 
In addition to historical styles there have also been styles associated with individual architects The Palladian style made its way from Andrea Palladio to Inigo Jones from him to Colen Campbell and Lord Burlington and thence to Thomas Jefferson It reappears in the work of contemporary Classicists such as Allan Greenberg H H Richardsons influence was considerably shorter lived but for at least years Richardsonian Romanesque rolled over the United States like an  aesthetic Juggernaut  in Crams colorful phrase Mies van der Rohes steel and glass style likewise prevailed for more than two decades and his characteristic I beam window mullion can still be seen in contemporary curtain walls 
Buildings like Jones Palladian Queens House in Greenwich Adler Sullivans Richardsonian Romanesque Auditorium Building in Chicago and Gordon Bunshafts Miesian Lever House are not copies but satisfying originals However most personal styles are not easily adaptable A building in Wrights unmistakable Prairie style for example simply looks like a knock off Some personal styles are simply too obsessive which is probably why Frank Furness and the equally idiosyncratic Barcelona architect Antonio Gaudí never attracted a following 
Inigo Jones consciously based his work on the architecture of Palladio but he did not think of himself as working in the Palladian  style  any more than Palladio would have referred to the Classical  style  Although Renaissance architects described their architecture as allantica in the antique manner they took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression the Romans improved on the Greeks and they would improved on the Romans According to the architecture historian Peter Collins the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late He cites James Stuart and Nicholas Revetts Antiquities of Athens published in and credited with inaugurating the Classical Revival in England The authors both architects referred to  the Grecian and Roman style of building  
The Latin root of  style is stilus A stilus was the sharp pointed tool used to write on wax tablets and by inference stilus also referred to the way that something was written This sense of technique carried over to English and the original meaning of style was those features of literary composition that belonged to the form rather than to the substance of the matter being expressed The seventeenth century English musical composer Samuel Wesley put it neatly  Style is the dress of thought  Jacques François Blondel who was Louis XVs architect and who founded the first full time school of architecture in Europe in adopted this literary meaning as a metaphor and described architectural style as a buildings character for example rustic regal or heroic  Style in the organization of façades and in the decoration of rooms is the poetry of architecture  he taught his students  which alone makes all the architects compositions truly interesting  
Literary style described the way that something was written expressed or performed Architectural style in Blondels sense describes the way that something was built Although architecture is often defined in terms of abstractions such as space light and volume buildings are above all physical artifacts The experience of architecture is palpable the grain of wood the veined surface of marble the cold precision of steel the textured pattern of brick But exactly what do we see when we look at brickwork  We see the joints between the bricks and the mortar which can be flush or scraped out to create shadows the bonding patterns the way that the bricks turn the corner the surrounding of openings and the connection between the brick wall and the foundation or the eaves What we see are details 
Details are a major preoccupation of the architect Once the overall form of a building is determined  the masterly correct and magnificent play of masses brought together in light there remains the question not only of what materials are to be used and how these will be assembled but also of how the hundreds of parts of the building are to be designed from the door frames and the window sills to the railings and the baseboards 
The function of a baseboard is to cover the joint between the wall and the floor and secondarily to protect the wall from scuffing There are dozens of ways that this can be done Baseboards can be prominent or discreet a complicated assembly of board cap and base or a simple strip of hardwood Or nothing many modern architects dispense with baseboards altogether The baseboards in my living room are twelve inches tall They are not wood but cast iron since they are really disguised radiators My house was built in influenced by the British Free Style of Voysey and Baillie Scott and to further preserve a simple rustic atmosphere the architect had the baseboards radiators painted to resemble wood 
Railings have a simple function they must be sturdy enough to support us if we lean on them and they must provide a secure hand hold if railings are open the spaces between the supports and the rails should be small enough to prevent children from falling through Classical railings developed during the Renaissance consist of balusters supporting a handrail Balusters little columns can have a single or a double swelling curve or a vase shape Fabricated in wood or masonry they can be round or square in cross section and plain or highly ornamented Railings can be replaced by parapets with pierced screens These can be stone or metal bronze wrought or cast iron The screens can be simple X shapes intertwining geometrical patterns or complicated floral figures as in Art Nouveau staircases Perhaps the simplest open railings are those of the great Adirondack camps whose builders mimicked X shaped wrought iron railings in unpeeled rustic tree trunks 
Modern railings are usually metal In his early villas Le Corbusier used white painted pipe railings to create a nautical image in later buildings like the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard flat steel bars take the place of pipes The railings in Mies van der Rohes buildings usually have only a single intermediate rail located precisely halfway between the handrail and the floor the vertical stanchions the handrail and the rail are made of identical square steel bars The railings in Louis Kahn buildings tend to be parapets but where he is obliged to use an open railing the design is as simple as possible I have seen a short stair railing that consisted of a single bronze bar bent at each end to form the uprights Richard Meier uses metal railings too but because there are sometimes as many as six horizontal rails the visual effect is more pronounced they resemble staffs in sheet music 
When Brutalism was in fashion railings were correspondingly heavy concrete beams wide enough to sit on but unpleasant to the touch or massive wood balustrades as solid as fenders on a truck dock The vogue among many younger architects today is toward lightness and exposed construction and railings reflect that fashion too The screens of the railings of Peter Roses Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal are industrial looking perforated sheets of anodized aluminum prominently bolted to the stanchions Bernard Tschumi substitutes steel cables complete with turnbuckles for the intermediate horizontal rails of the ramp railings of Lerner Hall at Columbia University another nautical reference but to a yacht rather than a steamship These solutions appear mannered compared to the simple railing that I M Pei designed for the East Building of the National Gallery The stainless steel handrail highlights the solidity of the rose colored Tennessee marble by appearing to float in mid air since it is supported by continuous sheets of tempered glass embedded in the floor 
The transparent railings of I M Peis East Building are understated elegant and luxurious like the building  Beauty will result from the form and correspondence of the whole with respect to the several parts  taught Palladio  of the parts with regard to each other and of these again to the whole  The successful relationship of the details to each other and to the building is governed by the architects sense of style That is why the architect of my house painted the radiators to resemble wood a technologically inclined architect might have painted them silver a minimalist would dispense with baseboards and hide the radiators in the wall The role of details is not to complement architecture details are architecture  The aesthetic understanding of architecture  writes Roger Scruton  is inseparable from a sense of detail  Mies van der Rohe is supposed to have said  God is in the details  He did not mean that details are functionally important although they are or that good details prolong the life of a building although they do He meant that details are the soul of architecture That is why just as an archaeologist can reconstruct a pot from a few shards or a paleontologist can surmise the form of a prehistoric animal from bone fragments it is possible to divine the architects idea of a building by examining its details 
The house that Robert Venturi built for his mother in shook the foundations of the International Style much of this effect was the result of details Although Venturi obviously was working in a Modernist idiom there is a strip window and a steel pipe railing he also incorporated distinctly un Modernist features such as trim both inside and out Classical architects use a large variety of moldings fillet astragal egg and dart ogee that can be combined and recombined to great decorative effect The International Style in its effort to do away with ornament outlawed trim Walls were flat planes Windows had no frames Joints between materials were simply hairline cracks The conspicuous exterior dado the baseboards and the chair rails in the Vanna Venturi House were hardly Classical moldings they were merely boards with chamfered edges yet they challenged the assumption that trim and Modernism were incompatible 
Coming through the front door of the Vanna Venturi House one immediately senses that it is an unusual place A broad stair rises beside the fireplace then peters out to almost nothing The fireplace looks like an abstract sculpture but it has a traditional mantelpiece A free standing column à la Corbusier stands beside a chair rail Then there is the furniture Ever since the Tugendhat House for which Mies had designed the furniture it was taken for granted that modern houses required modern furniture Venturi has explained that  I designed the house so my mothers old furniture c plus some antiques would look good in it  Instead of the iconic bent tube Breuer chairs there are homely ladderback chairs around the dining table instead of an Eames lounge chair and ottoman a comfortable stuffed sofa It is a contradictory atmosphere the International Style willfully distorted through the lens of traditional bourgeois domesticity 
Whether one is looking up at the tall dome of the Pantheon descending the spiraling vortex of Wrights Guggenheim Museum or standing in the living room of Venturis small house the experience of architecture is above all the experience of being in a separate distinct world That is what distinguishes architecture from sculpture it is not an object but a place The sense of being in a special place that is a three dimensional expression of the architects imagination is one of the distinctive pleasures of architecture To create a strong sense of place the surroundings must be all of a piece space mass shapes and materials must reflect the same sensibility That is why details are so important A jarring detail or an inconsistency something  out of place and the fantasy begins to crumble Yes fantasy Illusion has been a part of architecture ever since the ancient Greeks made columns with a gently swelling taper to deceive the eye This is not to say that architecture is stage décor When the wind blows the canvas scenery blows over the building resists the elements Architecture surrounds and shelters us It is the real world but it is also a vision 
   
The Postmodern movement that followed the Vanna Venturi House was relatively short lived but it had an important consequence it broke the stranglehold of Modernism leaving designers free to explore other forms of expression The profusion of styles that ensued is demonstrated by the work of three gifted but vastly different architects Allan Greenberg Hugh Newell Jacobsen and Enrique Norten 
Allan Greenberg is a confirmed Classicist He does not consider this an anomaly  To be truly modern  he writes  means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present Classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed  Although Greenberg looks to the past his is not the attitude of an archeologist Like Carrère Hastings and generations of architects before them Greenberg approaches Classicism as a tradition to be studied absorbed then extended 
Early in his career after emigrating to the United States from South Africa Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses which led to an unusual commission the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse He gave the commercial building in Manchester Connecticut a new façade dominated by a large arch over scaled voussoirs and a pediment Inside the barrel vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order Greenberg had graduated from Yale in and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism However unlike Venturi and Moore Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building he was returning to Classical roots From this modest beginning over the next two decades came a variety of commissions a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building several college and university buildings and a Roman Catholic church His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens Georgia a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills Greenberg is also known for large country houses both in the United States and in Europe Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work using Georgian and American Colonial styles One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon another by Palladios unfinished Villa Thiene Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim Mead White 
One of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard Completed in the low lying building is shingled but it is not exactly Shingle Style Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts giving them a fussy and nervous appearance Such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away Greenbergs aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub The one story Atlantic façade is almost perfectly symmetrical a large arched window flanked by two semi circular bays rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds The two story landward side is more informal ringed by a sheltered porch Massivity informs the details sturdy Tuscan columns a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof rugged window frames The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves Inside the fireplace has a brick hearth a slate lintel and a wood surround whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough reused timbers Although most people would describe this house as  traditional  this is not an exercise in a particular historical style There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect C F A Voysey and it is obvious that Greenberg has looked at Lutyens country houses But this is a modern house although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility It admirably fulfills Palladios call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the whole 
Hugh Newell Jacobsen studied at Yale under Louis Kahn worked for Philip Johnson and opened his own office in He established himself as a premier residential architect winning commissions in the United States and abroad and receiving numerous design awards Several of the awards were for restoration of historic buildings notably the Renwick Gallery in Washington D C and the Hôtel Talleyrand in Paris A Modernist by training and inclination Jacobsen was nevertheless affected by the winds of change unleashed by Venturis little house Starting in he evolved a hybrid style in which American regional forms and materials are combined with International Style precision spareness and simplicity A house on Nantucket in shingles and white trim looks vernacular until one notices the careful proportions and refined elegant details such as tall French doors in the living room that slide into wall pockets that also conceal shutters and screen doors A post and beam Caribbean guest house with broad overhangs has the ingenuous simplicity of a beach shack The Palladian plan and temple like pavilions of an Ohio residence pay homage to the local Greek Revival An Ohio country house recalls a board and batten Gothic Revival farmhouse  I endeavor to design buildings that express a sense of belonging  Jacobsen says  buildings that reflect or abstract the nearby architecture and the traditions dictated by the climate and local materials  
The Palmedo House built in reinterprets the American Colonial architecture of its location Long Island At first glance the six pavilions resemble a little village a little Amish village judging from the austere white wood siding the prim details and the identical pitched roofs Each pavilion is a perfect little  house with identical square and vertical multi paned windows that open by sliding into cunning wall pockets This sounds precious but Jacobsen is not a romantic The central  house contains the living room a three story space open to the roof Although the multi paned windows are present at an upper level of the wall the corner of the room is glazed with large mullionless sheets of plate glass offering dramatic views of Long Island Sound This is an International Style device as is the economy of detail and the clean cool atmosphere of the interior On the other hand the fireplace which in an orthodox International Style house would be painted brick or bush hammered concrete is decorously built into the wall which gives the room a traditional civilized air The chief idea here is to highlight the tension between old and new between the traditional clapboarded architecture and the demands of modern life Whereas Greenberg seamlessly resolves this tension Jacobsen allows it to surface If this sounds like textbook Postmodernism it is not Jacobsen artlessly combines new and old without the slightest hint of irony 
Jacobsen reacts to the collapse of Modernism by seeking a compromise position while Greenberg anchors himself in the certainties of Classicism Enrique Norten the youngest of the three takes a different course he is trying to put Modernism back together again Norten who studied at Cornell established his office in his native Mexico City in In a relatively short time he produced an impressive body of work that includes institutional commercial and residential buildings His major projects are a services building for the media giant TELEVISA and the National School of Theater Both incorporate bulging metal shell roofs that recall the s buildings of the French architect engineer Jean Prouvé Prouvé was intent on applying new methods of construction particularly industrialization and prefabrication His buildings extremely light and assembled from standardized elements were real  machines for living  Norten too is preoccupied with industrial building technologies the lighter the better Double tensed glass curtain walls are mysteriously supported by a steel frame Roofs hang by steel cables from steel masts Slender canted columns brace a glass roofed portico Railings in a Norten design are almost always opportunities for structural legerdemain suspended sheets of glass stretched steel cables perforated metal screens 
In Norten built a house for himself and his family on a tight urban site in Mexico City The three story street façade is mostly a blank concrete wall the wall facing the interior walled patio is entirely glass The main living floor is open except for the kitchen the upper bedroom floor is shaded and given privacy by a redwood louvered screen A functionalist style pervades the house The clinical cabinetwork is white painted wood A concrete wall in the dining room is bare save for the regular pattern of the formwork ties and the pour lines marks The windows are large sections of plate glass in simple aluminum frames a  foot section slides aside to entirely open the dining room to the patio The sliding wall recalls the disappearing windows in Mies van der Rohes Tugendhat House but the resemblance ends here Mies spare interior is opulent and assertive Nortens is austere almost monastic a neutral background for family life This is an unsentimental idea of the home Not exactly a  machine for living  but certainly machinelike in its precision and rational layout 
Like Greenberg and Jacobsen Norten reflects on the past Although his house has little to do formally with the International Style of the flat roofed stucco villas of the s except for the white painted circular steel columns it shares that periods ambitions it is highly abstract idealistic technophile and lacking in applied ornament Decoration results not from trim but from the surface quality of the different materials concrete red oak flooring etched glass and from the relentless articulation of structural connections Nortens buildings exhibit another feature of the International Style they are placeless That is while they carefully respond to the specifics of the program and the site they do not explicitly acknowledge their immediate regional context Whether they are in Mexico or New Mexico where Norten is building a heritage center the style is the same understated coolly competent cosmopolitan 
Whether one prefers the work of Greenberg Jacobsen or Norten is a matter of taste I happen to like all three The buildings are different yet the three architects have something in common They are serious about what they are doing that is their buildings exhibit a strong sense of conviction They pay enormous attention to details They are disciplined but they understand their self imposed rules well enough to occasionally break them Moreover while their architecture is built with a great sense of style it is never merely stylized That is because in their buildings style the manner of expression is always in the service of content that which is being expressed Style without content quickly degenerates into caricature like a speaker who makes grand gestures and rhetorical flourishes but has nothing to say The buildings of Greenberg Jacobsen and Norten on the contrary have a great deal to tell us about our past our surroundings and ourselves 
Greenberg Jacobsen and Norten do not describe what they do in terms of style I think that there are a number of reasons that architects are uncomfortable talking about the subject A suspicion of style is a heritage of the Modern Movement which preached against the arbitrary dictates of style and fashion while maintaining an unspoken but rigid stylistic consistency So deep rooted is this teaching that it remains a moral stricture on most architects whether or not they are Modernists Perhaps another reason for the reluctance to discuss style is fear Fear that being linked to a particular style is to be put in a box like most creative people architects dislike being categorized Also fear that talking about style will make architecture a serious business sound frivolous Better to leave that to interior decorators and fashion designers professions that architects regard with a mixture of disdain and envy Finally there is an unspoken fear of style because it is subject to the whims and the fancies of fashion That fear at least seems to me to be ill founded An architecture that recognizes style and fashion would not be an architecture that is introspective and self referential as are so many contemporary buildings It would be part of the world not architecture for architects but architecture for the rest of us And that would not be a bad thing 

Coda
Richard Morris Hunt was the most celebrated American architect of the late nineteenth century His preeminence is reflected by his appointment as the architect of two important national works the centerpiece building of the Chicago Worlds Columbian Exposition and the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty He was feted at home and abroad Hunt was the first architect to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard and the first American to receive a Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects and he was made an honorary member of the French Académie and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor A hundred years later his counterpart is Frank O Gehry Since being awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize in Gehry has gone on to win more honors than any other living architect including such major arts awards as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize a non architectural award of which he is the first recipient and the Japanese Praemium Imperiale the Nobel of the art world Even the staid American Institute of Architects which had previously shunned Gehry in lieu of more mainstream practitioners awarded him its top accolade the AIA Gold Medal 
No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica Yet they bear comparison They were both late bloomers Gehry was when he gained national recognition Until then he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years building shopping centers suburban offices department stores and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L A modern The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood corrugated metal and chain link fencing The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick That was in Unexpectedly he attracted a broad range of commissions not only residential clients but also museums public institutions universities corporations and developers and not only in the United States but around the world 
Hunt was when he came into his own He had established an architectural practice in New York in almost immediately on his return from the Ecole des Beaux Arts He was moderately successful achieving local renown for the Tribune Building an early New York skyscraper Despite his Parisian background Hunt worked in the prevalent Ruskinian Gothic style Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote  The building is of Gothic design with very red brick and very irregular stone dressings which it must be confessed regretfully are not pleasing to the eye  For his next project the Lenox Library Hunt tried something different He borrowed from the French Neo Grec style popularized by Labrouste in the Bibliothèque Sainte Geneviève adding Renaissance details and his own characteristically vigorous surface modeling The result was a startling departure from convention a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity The Lenox Library which stood on Fifth Avenue on the site of the present day Frick Collection marked a shift in architectural taste away from Ruskin to a grand and frankly aesthetic Classicism The s was a decade of great prosperity and newly wealthy New Yorkers eagerly sought out Hunts architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display He obliged them in a string of high profile commissions magnificent mansions along Fifth Avenue country houses on Long Island and palatial  cottages in Newport Rhode Island Hunt died in but in the last seven years of his life he completed more than fifty projects 
Biltmore House in Asheville North Carolina is a good example of his stylistic prowess Hunt modeled the design of this  room residence on the Château de Blois whose style is not the severe Classicism of the Italian Renaissance favored by architects such as Charles McKim but the more ornate and picturesque French Renaissance To a modern visitor the spires turrets and steep slate roofs of Biltmore recall Disneylands Sleeping Beauty Castle which is not surprising since Disney also used a Loire Valley chateau the Château dUssé as his model But the comparison does Hunt an injustice for his design is neither prettified nor quaint His client George W Vanderbilt was a young bachelor he married soon after the house was finished and for him Hunt created an architecture that is robust masculine and immensely self assured not in the least like a fairytale 
Vanderbilt was drawn to French chateaux which Hunt showed him during a whirlwind European tour since young George and his wealthy family imagined themselves American aristocrats There are coats of arms bearing Vs all over the house Hunt provides his client with an imagined regal setting but deals with the past in his own peculiar way Although he modeled the building on Blois he makes no attempt to create a replica of the sixteenth century chateau but draws details from other buildings of the period and recombines them into an original whole Nor does he try to create the illusion that this is a sixteenth century building there is no artificial weathering no aging effect no simulated historicism The interior is modern bright and open The focus of the main floor is a glass roofed conservatory a common nineteenth century feature The stonework of the house is impeccable much crisper and more sharply defined than at Blois Hunt was no antiquarian and modern American technology abounds The floors of fireproof hollow tile are supported by steel I beams and the steep slate roofs by steel roof trusses Cast iron replaces wrought iron and high quality bricks fired in the estate brickworks back up the limestone walls Equally novel are the elevators and telephones electrical lighting hot and cold running water and forced air central heating There is no doubt that for Hunt Biltmore is an up to the minute modern building That is part of its style too 
Like Hunt Frank Gehry enlists novel materials in his buildings The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao Spain for example is clad in titanium previously used chiefly for building aircraft The metallic walls curve twist and turn One part of the building slides under an adjoining bridge another emerges from a reflecting pool Bilbainos refer to the museum as the  artichoke  which comes close to describing it if you can imagine a gleaming metallic artichoke more than two hundred feet high The seeming disorder a chaotic collision of forms has no architectural precedent This is not sculptural architecture it is walk in sculpture 
 The plan is the generator preached Le Corbusier but with Gehry the plan is the result He appears to design from the outside in The building as a composition comes first the interior spaces follow This implies that he shoehorns functions into the building which is not the case The Guggenheim has three distinct types of gallery spaces traditional skylit rooms for displaying its permanent collection of early Modernist art a long boat like space for temporary installations and smaller galleries each with its own character each dedicated to the works of a selected living artist The artichoke accommodates them all The building may appear offhanded but there is nothing haphazard about the way it is organized 
Gehrys talent is his exceptional formal imagination his skill as an architect is to reconcile the forms he imagines with the functional demands of his client And of course to find ways to build those forms This is generally done without fuss The titanium sheets simply follow the churning surfaces like shingles on a Shingle Style roof limestone is used in a similarly unaffected fashion without articulated joints Gehry shares a minimalist approach to details with the early architects of the International Style but he deploys these details to different ends By removing familiar elements such as coping strips fascias and trim he accentuates the sculptural quality of his buildings There are no roofs or walls or windows in the Guggenheim there are only swirling and twisting planes of metal stone and glass An architecture critic once described Gehry as  a smart man from Hollywood  which nicely captures the architects blend of exuberant showmanship and canny behind the scenes savvy 
Although sophisticated building techniques and innovative materials play a major role in Gehrys buildings like Hunt he keeps technology off center stage In that regard he repudiates the mannered industrial style that pervades the work of many contemporary architects Neither is he nostalgic about the past Gehry rejects both the moralistic functionalism of the International Style and the traditions of Classicism Architects have broken rules in the past but rarely this unequivocally and totally 
Gehry like Hunt has changed the course of architecture That is he has made us look at our surroundings in a different way The world of Gehrys buildings is at first glance an odd place The line between order and disorder is a thin one and it is difficult to know what is intended and what is accidental But his colliding forms and agitated architecture are curiously unthreatening This is the way we live today Gehry seems to be saying why not enjoy it 


 
 
 
 Introduction
 Older adults are frequently counseled to lose weight 
 even though there is little evidence that overweight is
 associated with increased mortality in those over age 
 Six large controlled population based studies of
 non smoking older adults have investigated the association
 between body mass index BMI and mortality controlling
 for relevant covariates All studies found
 excess risk for persons with very low BMI but that persons
 with moderately high BMI had little or no extra risk except
 in certain small subsets A review of studies of older
 adults drew similar conclusions 
 Many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain
 throughout adult life It may be that a small amount of
 gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the
 most robust health as we age It has been suggested that
 weight standards be adjusted upwards for age Such
 recommendations remain controversial however because the
 number of studies of older persons is fairly small and
 because few studies have examined the relation of BMI to
 quality of life or years of healthy life YHL in the
 elderly 
 In older adults risk factors may have a greater effect
 on health than on mortality If so then behavior change
 trials of weight modification might be more successful if
 they were evaluated on improved health rather than on
 decreased mortality Clinical trials powered to detect
 differences in YHL would often require fewer subjects than
 trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular
 events In this paper we study whether BMI at
 baseline is associated with living longer and or with more
 years of being healthy in a cohort of older adults for
 whom risk factors subclinical disease and morbidity are
 well characterized The goal is to determine whether
 analyses based on years of life YOL or on YHL would
 provide substantively different results and which measure
 would yield more powerful evaluations of weight
 modification interventions in older adults 
 
 
 Materials and methods
 
 Study design The Cardiovascular Health
 Study
 The Cardiovascular Health Study CHS is a
 population based longitudinal study of adults aged
 and older at baseline Subjects were recruited
 from a random sample of the Medicare eligibility lists in
 four US counties Extensive baseline data were collected
 for all subjects using a baseline home interview an
 annual mail questionnaire and annual clinic
 examinations Additional information was collected in a
 brief telephone interview months after each scheduled
 visit Two cohorts were followed one with years of
 follow up n   and the second all African
 American n   with years of follow up to date 
 Data collection began in and follow up is virtually
 complete for all surviving subjects 
 
 
 Body mass index
 BMI was calculated as measured weight in kilograms
 divided by the square of measured height in meters A
 report from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute
 classifies normal weight without reference to age as a
 BMI of to overweight as to and
 obesity as and higher We consider
 separately the group with BMI between and which
 was associated with lower survival in studies cited
 above 
 
 
 Years of life and years of healthy life
 YOL is the number of years that a person lived in the
 years after baseline YHL is the number of years in
 which the person was healthy and is similar in concept
 to quality adjusted life years healthy year equivalents 
 or active life expectancy We based YHL on
 self rated health is your health excellent very good 
 good fair or poor  EVGFP which was collected every 
 months EVGFP is a simple but well known measure which
 has been studied in detail and is predictive
 of health events in many studies Because we are
 examining health status over time we added a sixth
 health state dead Data were available about of the
 time We used linear interpolation to estimate missing
 data when there were known values before and after the
 missing value bringing the percent complete to 
 
 For this analysis we defined YHL as the number of
 years of in which a person reported excellent very
 good or good health were healthy YHL ranges from 
 for persons who were never in excellent very good or
 good health to years for persons who were healthy
 throughout Since people reported their health every 
 months YHL has a reasonably continuous distribution A
 drawback of this simple definition of healthy is that
 it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and
 death since all are considered not healthy We also
 used an alternative approach which assigns a different
 value to each level of EVGFP Preliminary results
 were similar for the two approaches however and we
 report results using only the simpler definition 
 The calculations had to be modified to include the 
 persons in the second African American cohort who have
 been followed only years to date For those persons 
 and for persons in the first cohort who did not have
 complete data we estimated the last years of YOL and
 YHL from their age sex and health at the end of 
 years using validated methods presented elsewhere 
 That article showed that estimated  year YOL and YHL
 were unbiased for the African American cohort In the
 primary analysis we used observed  year YOL and YHL when
 they were available and observed  year YOL and YHL plus
  year estimated YOL and YHL when they were not about
 of the sample We performed all analyses with and
 without the persons who had partially estimated data to
 ensure that the estimation had not distorted the
 findings 
 
 
 Covariates
 The goal is to examine the association of YOL and YHL
 with BMI To adjust for possible confounding we chose
 baseline covariates that were prevalent in the elderly 
 related to mortality and morbidity in previous studies 
 and likely to be related to BMI Self reported covariates
 include age gender smoking never or former history
 of arthritis cancer diabetes fair or poor self rated
 health status limitations in activities of daily living
 or in instrumental activities of daily living and 
 pounds or more unintended weight loss in the year before
 baseline Clinical covariates include hypertension 
 cardiovascular disease prevalent heart disease 
 peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease 
 maximum thickness of the internal carotid artery 
 depression CESD score serum albumin serum
 cholesterol and serum creatinine These measures are
 explained in more detail elsewhere We
 excluded current smokers and others with
 incomplete covariate data leaving persons on whom
 this analysis is based 
 
 
 Analysis
 All analyses were performed separately for men and
 women We calculated two sets of adjusted values as
 follows We regressed YOL and YHL first on age age
 squared race and smoking history former or never and
 second on all of the covariates listed above We
 calculated adjusted YOL as a persons observed YOL minus
 predicted YOL from the regression plus the mean YOL
 years for women or for men That is a
 persons adjusted YOL is his residual from the regression
 plus the grand mean The mean of this new variable for a
 group of subjects is the adjusted mean YOL for that
 group Adjusted YHL was calculated in a similar manner 
 We calculated two sets of adjusted variables because of
 the possibility of over adjustment controlling
 inappropriately for factors such as diabetes which may
 have been causally affected by the persons weight We
 plotted mean adjusted YOL and YHL against BMI and tested
 for difference among BMI groups using confidence
 intervals or analysis of variance Finally we calculated
 the effect size for each measure comparing each BMI
 subgroup to the normal group The effect size is the
 difference in mean YOL or YHL in two groups divided by
 their common standard deviation Since the sample size
 required to detect an effect of this magnitude is
 proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size 
 large effect sizes are desirable 
 
 
 
 Results
 Table shows the distribution of key variables by sex
 and race Mean age at baseline was and about two
 thirds of the men and a third of the women were former
 smokers Black women had a higher mean BMI and higher
 percent obese BMI ≥ than the other three groups Black
 men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than
 pounds in the past year white women were least
 likely 
 About of the subjects were healthy at baseline 
 declining to at the end of years had died data
 not shown Of the who were unhealthy fair or poor at
 baseline about were healthy years later There was
 thus substantial change in EVGFP over time in both
 directions Table shows the mean YOL and YHL calculated
 from EVGFP in the first seven years of the study adjusted
 to age For example black women averaged YOL but
 only YHL of a maximum possible We calculated some
 additional descriptive statistics shown in the final two
 lines years of unhealthy life YOL minus YHL and years
 lost to death minus YOL White women had the most YHL
 and black men the fewest black women had the most years of
 unhealthy life and white men the fewest black men lost
 the most years to death out of while white women
 lost only years For blacks about of their YOL
 were healthy YHL YOL not shown for whites about 
 were healthy 
 Among whites the gender differences in Table were
 statistically significant p < except for BMI and
 unintended weight loss Among blacks gender differences
 were significant except for pounds unintended weight
 loss and weight loss since age Among males there were
 significant differences between black and white for BMI 
 unintended weight loss YOL YHL years of unhealthy life 
 and years lost to death Whites in the sample had higher
 income and education data not shown After adjusting for
 income and education as well as age and former smoking 
 the difference in BMI was no longer statistically
 significant Among females blacks and whites differed
 significantly on BMI BMI> weight loss since age 
 YOL YHL years of unhealthy life and years lost to death 
 After adjustment for income and education the difference
 in weight loss since age was no longer significant 
 Blacks had significantly lower YOL and YHL than whites
 after adjustment for age but the difference disappeared
 after adjustment for the entire set of health related
 baseline covariates analyses not shown 
 We next examined the relationship of BMI to YOL and YHL 
 Table presents the mean values of YOL and YHL adjusted
 for age race and previous smoking columns and and
 also adjusted for the entire set of covariates columns 
 and For example YOL for women adjusted for age race 
 and smoking averaged years for women with a baseline
 BMI below but averaged years for women with a BMI
 from to The second column which shows results
 adjusted for all covariates is not very different the
 only discrepancy is for men with BMI < a category
 containing only men Adjustment for extensive
 covariates also made little difference for YHL columns 
 and Subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age 
 race and former smoking As mentioned above the group
 with BMI from to would be considered normal by
 the NHLBI guidelines but had lower YOL and YHL than those
 with   in all comparisons For this reason and to
 increase sample size for those with low BMI we combined
 the two lower categories defining underweight as a BMI
 under 
 Figure is a plot of adjusted YOL and YHL by sex and
 BMI For each BMI category the mean and its confidence
 interval are plotted Categories whose confidence intervals
 do not overlap or overlap only slightly are significantly
 different The bars are slightly offset to permit all error
 bars to be seen 
 YOL for women the uppermost curve on Figure averaged
 about out of years and showed no evident association
 between BMI and YOL for BMI above Underweight women
 averaged about fewer YOL than other women p < 
 compared with normal group Underweight men also had lower
 YOL but this group was not significantly different from
 the normal group in part because of low sample size Men
 classified as normal overweight or obese all had about the
 same YOL 
 The lowermost two lines in Figure show mean YHL for
 women and men Women who were normal or overweight averaged
 about YHL The YHL for underweight or obese women was
 about years which was significantly lower than the
 normal group The relationship of BMI to YHL for men is
 similar but differences among BMI groups were not
 statistically significant YHL was significantly higher for
 women than for men in the normal and overweight groups but
 the sexes had similar YHL in the underweight and obese
 groups 
 We next present the effect size for comparing each group
 to the normal BMI group The effect sizes are shown in
 Table with the significance results of the associated
 t tests for the differences in means of the two groups
 being compared For example underweight women averaged
 YHL compared to for normal women and the common
 standard deviation was The effect size is thus
       The two groups had significantly
 different YHL implying that the effect size is also
 significantly greater than zero A clinical trial of a
 treatment to help underweight women achieve normal weight
 presumably by addressing the underlying cause could be
 expected to have power with N        
 about women per treatment arm if  year YHL were the
 outcome measure 
 The biggest effect sizes are in the first row comparing
 underweight to normal YHL and YOL have similar effect
 sizes for women and are significantly different from zero 
 The effect sizes are not significantly different from zero
 for men in part because there were only men in the
 underweight category The effect size comparing overweight
 to normal yielded small non significant effect sizes with
 inconsistent signs suggesting extremely large sample sizes
 would be needed For comparing obese to normal only YHL
 for women showed a large and significant effect size Thus 
 an intervention to improve the health of underweight women
 to that of their normal weight peers could be performed
 using either YHL or YOL as the outcome variable Trials to
 make obese women comparable to normal women could be
 evaluated using YHL but not YOL Trials to improve the
 health of the other groups to that of the normals would
 probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being
 overweight for men or women or obese for men affects
 YOL or YHL 
 As mentioned above we repeated these analyses excluding
 the persons with partially estimated data and using two
 different ways of coding YHL The only substantive change
 was that some of the differences between blacks and whites
 shown in Table were no longer statistically significant 
 due to a smaller sample size 
 
 
 Discussion
 
 Optimal weight and overweight
 Recent studies have defined obesity without reference
 to age Andres 
 et al proposed a desirable BMI of
   for persons aged to Allison 
 et al proposed   for
 older men and   for older women In Figure the
 overweight as opposed to the obese are no different
 from those of normal weight suggesting that these two
 categories could be combined for older adults Since
 future improvements in life expectancy may be limited 
 the greatest advances may be made by improving
 peoples YHL This suggests that the development of
 future guidelines should take YHL or other measures of
 quality of life into account 
 
 
 Implications for clinical trials
 Based on these findings trials to address obesity in
 older women could be efficient if YHL but not YOL was
 the outcome measure That is women who changed from
 being obese to being normal would likely show changes in
 YHL but not YOL Clinical trials of weight modification
 interventions for older adults who were merely overweight
 would appear to be fruitless since the interventions
 would probably not have a direct effect on either YOL or
 YHL 
 Weight or weight change are sometimes used as the
 outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or
 exercise programs The fact that weight is not associated
 in a consistent way with health suggests that such
 evaluations should be considered critically when older
 adults are the subjects This is particularly important
 in the light of recent findings which found that
 interventions such as weight loss drugs may be harmful 
 For older adults the risks associated with
 higher weight are especially unclear and the optimal
 outcome for a trial of weight loss in older adults
 requires specific attention to improved health and
 mortality 
 Interestingly the strongest health relationships were
 found for underweight older adults Clinical trials whose
 objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their
 normal weight peers presumably by addressing the
 underlying conditions that caused the low weight could
 be performed efficiently using either YOL or YHL as the
 outcome measure Both YOL and YHL would be clinically
 significant in this patient group 
 
 
 Potential limitations
 CHS participants were somewhat healthier than the
 average older adult however adjustment for detailed
 covariates made little difference in the findings We
 estimated the last four years of health data for about
 of the sample but results with and without this
 group were similar Analysis of mean YOL instead of the
 more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was
 appropriate here since virtually no persons were lost to
 follow up Biases caused by over adjustment are probably
 not large since the findings were not sensitive to the
 number of variables adjusted for 
 These results are for a  year follow up The relative
 superiority of YHL to YOL would probably hold in trials
 with shorter follow up The effect sizes in Table might
 also be appropriate in shorter trials since lengthy
 trials often add little information 
 EVGFP on which YHL was based might have missed some
 effects of obesity on risk factors for future health A
 person who is depressed because of a poor self image
 related to obesity or who has osteo arthritis related to
 obesity and limits to activities to successfully avoid
 pain would surely have worse EVGFP than others based on
 results from many studies However health measures
 designed specifically to measure those conditions might
 be more sensitive to change in weight than EVGFP If YHL
 were based on such measures the superiority of YHL to
 YOL would likely be even greater than that shown here 
 These more sensitive measures might also have detected
 differences between the overweight and normal weight
 persons but we think this is unlikely given the absence
 of any differences in EVGFP 
 
 
 
 Conclusion
 Recommendations for desirable weight have been
 criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health We
 found associations between YHL and obesity that were not
 present in the mortality analysis suggesting that YHL may
 be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in
 older adults especially for women Future efforts to
 determine desirable weight guidelines should include
 measures of YHL Using either YOL or YHL however we found
 no excess risk for older adults who would be classified as
 overweight by the NHLBI guidelines This suggests using
 YHL as the outcome measure in clinical trials involving
 obese or underweight older adults and discouraging trials
 that address older adults who are merely overweight

 The problem
 Three published and one recently presented 
 randomized placebo controlled clinical trial have
 unequivocally demonstrated that  Hydroxy   methylgluatryl
 coenzyme A HMG CoA reductase inhibitors statins reduce
 the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary
 disease These trials found that when compared with
 placebo statins significantly reduced the incidence of
 death myocardial infarction unstable angina percutaneous
 and surgical coronary revascularization and stroke in
 persons with 
 stable coronary disease Because
 patients who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome
 within three to six months of enrollment were excluded 
 these trials did not assess the effect of lipid lowering
 therapy on adverse cardiovascular events in those with
 recently 
 unstable coronary disease Whether
 lipid lowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if
 initiated immediately following an acute coronary syndrome
 is an important issue as the risk of a recurrent adverse
 cardiac events is much greater in patients with unstable
 coronary disease than in the stable setting The Myocardial
 Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering
 MIRACL trial set out to answer this question 
 
 
 The answer 
 MIRACL enrolled patients within   hours mean
 hours of admission for unstable angina or a non Q wave
 myocardial infarction and randomized them to weeks of
 atorvastatin mg or placebo once daily The major
 exclusion criteria were total cholesterol level greater
 than mg dL Q wave myocardial infarction on admission
 or during the previous month and coronary
 revascularization in the months before admission during
 the index hospitalization or anticipated following hospital
 discharge The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of
 death non fatal myocardial infarction resuscitated sudden
 cardiac death or emergent rehospitalization for worsening
 symptomatic myocardial ischemia Secondary endpoints
 included stroke worsening heart failure need for coronary
 revascularization and change in lipid levels throughout the
 study On average patients were years of age 
 approximately were men Caucasian and the mean
 baseline low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol level
 was mg dL Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a
 absolute reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint
 vs RR relative risk RR 
 confidence interval CI   p   This
 reduction was primarily driven by the absolute
 reduction in incidence of emergent rehospitalization for
 symptomatic myocardial ischemia vs RR 
 CI   p   The risk of death nonfatal
 myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden cardiac death
 were each no different between the two groups While there
 were no significant differences in the incidence of
 worsening heart failure or need for coronary
 revascularization atorvastatin did reduce the incidence of
 fatal or non fatal stroke by vs RR 
 CI   p   Atorvastatin also
 significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol and
 triglyceride levels but did not significantly change high
 density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol by weeks By 
 weeks the adjusted mean LDL cholesterol decreased to 
 mg dL in atorvastatin treated patients but increased to 
 mg dL among placebo treated patients No serious adverse
 events occurred as the result of treatment with
 atorvastatin although reversible liver transaminase
 elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal
 occurred in of atorvastatin treated versus of
 placebo treated patients p < 
 
 
 The MIRACuLous
 The efficacy and safety findings from MIRACL were unique
 for a number of reasons Although lipid lowering therapy
 was associated with a significantly lower mortality when
 initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome in two
 large observational studies MIRACL was the first
 randomized trial to suggest that statins confer clinical
 benefits in this setting It was also the first trial to
 identify a short term ie within weeks clinical
 benefit from statin therapy in previous secondary
 prevention trials the benefit of statin therapy was not
 evident for one to two years And while clinical trial
 safety endpoints may be considered less glamorous MIRACLs
 most important contribution may have been that high dose
 statin therapy was not associated with serious harm 
 despite its use in the unstable setting Earlier secondary
 prevention statin trials had excluded patients with
 unstable coronary syndromes largely out of theoretical
 concern that statin mediated reductions in vascular smooth
 muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque 
 That no harm resulted from this aggressive treatment
 strategy should allay theoretical fears and by doing so
 remove a major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of
 lipid lowing therapy after coronary events 
 
 
 The not so MIRACuLous
 Despite these unique and important findings there were
 a number of inherent study limitations worth noting First
 and foremost the possibility of a null treatment effect
 cannot be ignored given the wide confidence intervals and
 hence marginally significant p value of for the
 effect of atorvastatin on the primary efficacy endpoint 
 Furthermore while the number of patients lost to follow up
 was small if adverse events had occurred in those treated
 with atorvastatin n   but not placebo n   the
 overall trial results may have been neutral rather than
 positive 
 The types of events prevented in MIRACL are also worth
 noting While rehospitalization for recurrent myocardial
 ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and
 health care costs other important endpoints were not
 significantly affected eg death myocardial infarction 
 resuscitated sudden cardiac death worsening heart failure 
 need for coronary revascularization etc The question of
 whether statins can prevent these and other adverse events
 when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome will
 require further study 
 The short duration of follow up is also particularly
 troubling While it is impressive that a clinical benefit
 was realized after only weeks of statin therapy the
 increased risk of adverse clinical events persists
 throughout the year following an acute coronary syndrome 
 Without longer clinical follow up it is not possible to
 assess the intermediate term effect if any of
 atorvastatin on hard endpoints such as death or myocardial
 infarction To do so would be critical in light of the lack
 of effect on these important endpoints at weeks 
 Unfortunately no late clinical follow up is planned 
 There were also a number of limitations that may have
 hampered the studys generalizability First patients who
 underwent recent revascularization or in whom it was
 planned were excluded Specifically patients who underwent
 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty PTCA or
 coronary artery bypass graft CABG surgery within the
 previous three or six months respectively were not eligible
 for inclusion The investigators reasoned that recurrent
 ischemic events in this population were likely to result
 from restenosis or bypass graft closure and that statins
 would be less likely to affect these processes 
 Nevertheless a number of trials have established the
 benefits of statin therapy 
 early after coronary
 revascularization Furthermore a number of
 recent trials have suggested that higher risk patients with
 non ST elevation acute coronary syndromes fair better when
 an early invasive strategy is applied and it
 is not uncommon for patients to be treated in this fashion 
 Second patients with Q wave myocardial infarction were not
 eligible for enrollment because it was felt that statins
 would not influence the development of important prognostic
 determinants such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
 ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical complications 
 Nevertheless patients who develop electrocardiographic
 Q waves represent a substantial proportion of all patients
 with myocardial infarction While their short term risk
 following hospital discharge is lower relative to those
 with a non Q wave myocardial infarction it is still much
 greater than in patients with stable coronary disease and
 the need for secondary prevention in this population is
 equally important Third despite the high risk nature of
 enrolled patients ie electrocardiogram ECG changes
 and or other objective evidence of ischemia the rate of
 platelet glycoprotein IIb IIIa inhibitor utilization was
 quite low Such therapy appears to be cost effective
 especially among high risk patients and is
 recommended under current American College of
 Cardiology American Heart Association guidelines 
 Fourth it may not be possible to ascertain whether these
 findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary
 syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels The small
 difference in number of primary endpoint events between
 atorvastatin and placebo groups make it difficult to
 dissect the relationship between baseline lipid levels and
 treatment effect further Consequently it remains
 uncertain whether one can extrapolate the MIRACL trial
 results to those who undergo coronary revascularization
 shortly before or after a coronary event who present with
 a Q wave myocardial infarction who are treated with
 platelet glycoprotein IIb IIIa inhibitors or who have
 relatively low admission LDL cholesterol levels 
 
 
 Time to change current practice
 Although MIRACL and the two aforementioned cohort
 studies suggest that lipid lowering agents exert short term
 clinical benefits when initiated soon after an acute
 coronary syndrome this remains an open question Even if
 these findings are not confirmed after further study one
 could still make a compelling argument that lipid lowering
 therapy barring contraindications should be initiated
 early and universally in patients who present with an acute
 coronary syndrome First the long term safety and
 effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of 
 stable coronary disease is
 well established Second as evidenced by
 MIRACL these agents are safe when initiated at the time of
 hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome Third the
 in hospital initiation of lipid lowering therapy appears to
 promote greater long term utilization of these agents 
 Finally although lipid levels may be
 unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome
 excepting total HDL and LDL HDL cholesterol ratios 
 the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary
 disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and
 non pharmacologic lipid lowering interventions to attain
 recommended cholesterol targets newer
 guidelines are even more stringent Furthermore 
 data from the recently presented Heart Protection Study
 suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of
 baseline cholesterol level Thus to withhold
 lipid lowering therapy from patients who present with an
 acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo 
 and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the
 secondary prevention setting have been dismal 
 
 
 
 More MIRACLes ahead 
 The ascertainment and quantification of any incremental
 benefit conferred by statin therapy initiated early after
 an acute coronary syndrome will require confirmation There
 is currently only one ongoing randomized placebo controlled
 trial of early versus delayed statin therapy in this
 setting A   Z Aggrastat to Zocor Merck The
 A   Z study is evaluating the efficacy of early treatment
 with simvastatin in patients following an episode of
 unstable angina or a non Q wave myocardial infarction In
 the first four months patients will be randomized to
 simvastatin mg daily or placebo Thereafter those
 patients treated with simvastatin in the first phase will
 receive mg of simvastatin daily and those treated with
 placebo mg of simvastatin daily The primary composite
 endpoint is the occurrence of cardiovascular death 
 non fatal myocardial infarction or rehospitalization for
 an acute coronary syndrome ACS at one year If A   Z
 demonstrates significant reductions in the incidence of
 adverse events during the first four months it would
 suggest an incremental clinical benefit from initiating
 these agents early after an acute coronary syndrome If
 benefits accrue but do so later during follow up it would
 be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more
 aggressive vs earlier lipid lowering therapy 
 The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection
 Therapy PROVE IT trial is looking at patients
 within days of an acute coronary syndrome and
 randomizing them to either pravastatin mg or
 atorvastatin mg daily Patients will be observed
 over at least years for the occurrence of myocardial
 infarction or other cardiovascular events Unlike MIRACL
 and the A   Z trials this study will not assess the
 efficacy of early statin therapy after an acute coronary
 syndrome rather it will examine the role of 
 more vs 
 less aggressive lipid lowering in
 this setting 
 In many would consider it unethical to withhold
 statins from patients with established coronary disease 
 This makes it unlikely that additional placebo controlled
 trials will be carried out in this area Future secondary
 prevention studies should look at patients with stable 
 or unstable disease and will need to
 address the comparative efficacy of different statins or
 newer agents assess the incremental benefit of
 combination therapy and determine whether there is a
 serum cholesterol floor below which reductions are
 unlikely to provide further clinical benefit

 Background
 Glutamate decarboxylase GAD catalyzes the formation of
 the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ amino butyric acid GABA 
 from glutamate In mammals the two isoforms of this
 enzyme GAD and GAD are expressed from two separate
 genes 
 Gad and 
 Gad respectively GABA
 signaling plays several roles in neuronal development 
 Early in CNS development GABA can modulate neuron
 progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration 
 survival and differentiation 
 In some classes of neural progenitors GABA
 stimulates these processes while in others it has an
 antagonistic activity For example recent work has
 demonstrated that GABA acts in the developing neocortex to
 stimulate the proliferation of progenitors in the
 ventricular zone while inhibiting the proliferation of
 progenitors in the subventricular zone Later during
 postnatal development normal GABAergic input is required
 for activity dependent plasticity in the visual cortex as
 shown in the 
 Gad knockout mouse In
 addition to these functions in the developing CNS GABA
 signaling is also required for the normal development of
 non neural tissues Targeted mutations of the 
 Gad gene lead to defective
 development of the secondary palate The cleft
 palate phenotype of the 
 Gad mutants suggests the involvement
 of GABA mediated signals in the normal development and
 differentiation of a structure derived from the oral
 epithelium and neural crest ecto mesenchyme This
 conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate
 defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in
 the   subunit of the GABA 
 A receptor 
 This intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for
 GABA mediated signaling in the development of a non neural
 structure the secondary palate The potential for this
 pathway to be involved in the early development of
 additional non neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly
 explored To address this question we surveyed 
 Gad transcript distribution in the
 non CNS tissues of the embryo Using a whole mount 
 in situ hybridization approach we
 found that 
 Gad is indeed expressed in a number
 of different regions and tissues A notable feature of this
 expression pattern is that 
 Gad transcripts accumulate in the
 specialized ectodermal structures that are involved in the
 formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth 
 These specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be
 sources of developmental signals In
 addition transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem
 cell population of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal
 endoderm and mesenchyme The expression patterns show that 
 Gad is expressed in several non CNS
 structures that are derived from each of the three germ
 layers of the embryo 
 
 
 Results
 The mouse 
 Gad gene is widely expressed in the
 embryonic central nervous system To define
 additional sites of expression outside of the CNS we
 analyzed the distribution of 
 Gad transcripts in E to E 
 mouse embryos by whole mount 
 in situ hybridization 
 
 Gad transcripts were not detected in
 E day embryos data not shown At E 
 Gad was readily detected in the
 tailbud figure A Expression in the tail continued
 through E and was undetectable by E figure
 B C Dand data not shown a period corresponding to
 secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo 
 Examination of sections from an E embryo revealed a high
 level of 
 Gad expression throughout the
 mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of
 the tailbud figure F No transcripts were detected in
 the surface ectoderm surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme
 figure F At more cranial levels within the tail 
 expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm ventral
 neural tube notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut
 figure E In the paraxial mesoderm the highest
 expression levels were also localized ventrally adjacent
 to the notochord figure E 
 In the pharyngeal region of E embryos 
 Gad RNA was detected in and around
 the second third and fourth pharyngeal pouches figure
 A Sections through the third pouch confirmed the
 presence of 
 Gad expression in the pouch endoderm
 data not shown Expression was particularly strong in the
 dorsal portion of this pouch figure B The additional
 diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal
 mesenchyme figure B The expression in the pharyngeal
 region was very transient transcripts were easily detected
 at E but only faintly at E and were not detectable
 by E 
 In the limb buds 
 Gad RNA was detected from E to
 E figure A B C D E F G H Transcripts were initially
 expressed in the pre apical ectodermal ridge pre AER at
 E figure A B and by E were seen in the definitive
 AER of the forelimb figure D At E 
 Gad was expressed in a diffuse
 stripe in the forelimb figure D while in the hindlimb
 expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm figure
 E By E forelimb AER expression was fading and
 expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal
 forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb
 figure G H The earlier activation of 
 Gad in the forelimb reflects the
 normal temporal order of events in limb development 
 Sections indicate that the expression within the limb buds
 was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme data not
 shown 
 Gad RNA was not detected in the
 limbs by whole mount 
 in situ hybridization after
 E 
 A dynamic pattern of 
 Gad expression was detected in the
 developing vibrissae from E to E figure

 supra orbital infra orbital and post oral vibrissae and
 in the posterior vibrissae in the lateral nasal and
 maxillary rows figure A B nomenclature as in 
 Gad RNA was also detected in some of
 the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage Expression
 was activated in a posterior to anterior towards the nose 
 progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows 
 reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development By
 E 
 Gad expression was detected in the
 anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows and was activated
 in the rhinal labial and submental vibrissae figure
 C D By E expression was strong in the labial 
 submental and rhinal vibrissae figure E F Sections of
 E whole mounts show that 
 Gad expression was localized to the
 epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae figure G H 
 and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate
 figure G 
 Control hybridizations using a sense strand 
 Gad probe were also performed 
 Embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any
 staining pattern at any of the stages tested E   E 
 Sense strand hybridization results for E and E 
 embryos are shown in figure 
 
 
 Discussion
 The expression results reported here show that 
 Gad was activated in several tissues
 outside of the central nervous system during mouse
 development Transcripts were not seen at E and were
 first detected at E It was surprising that this very
 early phase of 
 Gad expression was largely outside
 of the developing CNS and was localized in the tail bud
 mesenchyme and in the pre apical ectodermal ridge pre AER 
 of the forelimb bud As development proceeded 
 Gad was detected in pharyngeal
 endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae 
 The data demonstrate that 
 Gad is expressed in several sites
 outside of the developing CNS and in derivatives of all
 three germ layers We have also detected the expression of 
 Gad  lacZ transgenes in the
 developing vibrissae and limbs supporting the novel and
 surprising 
 in situ hybridization results we
 report here J J Westmoreland and B G C unpublished
 results 
 Previous studies have shown that 
 Gad can be regulated at the
 post transcriptional and translational level 
 Gad mRNA translation or protein
 stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level
 of GABA During embryogenesis 
 post transcriptional regulation occurs by alternative
 splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice 
 This alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop
 codon into the 
 Gad mRNA and can produce the
 truncated proteins GAD and GAD from its and 
 ends respectively The studies reported here used a probe
 that will detect the adult 
 Gad mRNA that encodes GAD as well
 as the embryonic alternatively spliced mRNA that can encode
 GAD and GAD These additional mechanisms of 
 Gad regulation may control the
 production of GAD proteins and the synthesis of GABA in the
 non neural cell types detected in our study 
 The whole mount 
 in situ hybridization data reported
 here extends the results of a recently published section 
 in situ hybridization study on
 E  E mouse embryos Our analysis showed that 
 Gad expression is first detectable
 earlier at E and revealed novel non CNS sites of
 expression in the pharyngeal region vibrissae tail bud
 and limb bud The results of the previous study 
 together with the data reported herein provide a
 comprehensive picture of 
 Gad expression in the E  E 
 mouse embryo 
 Previous studies have noted 
 Gad expression outside of the CNS In
 adults 
 Gad and 
 Gad have been detected in a number
 of tissues including kidney testis oviduct pancreatic
 islets and adrenal cortex Previously
 reported sites of embryonic 
 Gad expression outside of the brain
 and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens
 fibers and the olfactory pit In E  E 
 mouse embryos 
 Gad is expressed in the olfactory
 and the lens placodes the anlagen of the olfactory pit and
 lens fibers We also detected 
 Gad expression in these tissues
 please see figure Aand data not shown Expression of 
 Gad in the developing heart and blood
 vessels has also been reported We detected weak
 staining in the heart and did not detect blood vessel
 expression perhaps due to the very low levels of
 expression in developing vasculature Our results
 document localized expression of 
 Gad at additional non CNS sites in
 the mouse embryo suggesting a potential role for GABA
 signaling in the development of these structures 
 Our interest in the role of GABA signaling in developing
 tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from
 the cleft palate phenotype of the 
 Gad and the   GABA 
 A receptor subunit mutants 
 The genetic data strongly suggest that GABA acts
 through GABA 
 A receptors to modulate the development
 of this tissue Although the data reported here do not
 explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype they do
 indicate that 
 Gad is expressed in several
 additional non CNS tissues in the mouse embryo It is
 particularly noteworthy that these include the AER of the
 limb buds and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae 
 Both are ectodermal structures known to be sources of
 developmental signals required for morphogenesis and
 patterning It will be of interest to
 examine the expression pattern of GABA receptors in the
 mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling centers 
 Expression of GABA receptor subunits in adjacent tissues
 would indicate that these receptors read the developmental
 signals mediated by GABA in these structures and
 tissues 
 
 
 Conclusions
 The mouse gene encoding the kDa isoform of glutamate
 decarboxylase 
 Gad is expressed in the tail bud
 mesenchyme vibrissal placodes pharyngeal arches and
 pouches and the apical ectodermal ridge AER mesenchyme
 and ectoderm of the limb buds in mouse embryos from
 E  E Some of the 
 Gad expressing tissues vibrissal
 placodes AER are known sources of developmental signals 
 Other sites of expression correspond to stem cell
 populations that give rise to multiple differentiated
 tissues tail bud mesenchyme pharyngeal endoderm and
 mesenchyme The localized and dynamic expression pattern
 of 
 Gad suggests a wider role for GAD
 and GABA in the development of non neural tissues than was
 previously known

 Background
 Primary syndrome °SS is a systemic
 autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes
 keratoconjunctivitis sicca dry mouth xerostomia as
 well as involvement of other exocrine glands While °SS is
 typically considered an autoimmune exocrinopathy the
 immune destruction can often extend to affect non exocrine
 organs Around of patients with °SS can present with
 involvement of other organs such as the thyroid central
 nervous system lungs kidney and liver The association of
 liver disease and °SS was suggested more than years ago
 While liver involvement in °SS has been considered
  rare  only a few clinical studies specifically
 address this complication and evaluate the association of
 liver function tests abnormalities with the severity of
 °SS 
 Liver diseases associated with °SS include primary
 biliary cirrhosis PBC  autoimmune cholangitis 
 autoimmune hepatitis viral hepatitis B and C 
 sclerosing cholangitis
 and nodular regenerative hyperplasia In
 addition chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis has been found
 in patients with different types of liver cirrhosis 
 
 We report the results of a review of cases undertaken to
 determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests
 LFTs and liver disease in patients with °SS referred to
 a tertiary care center and the association of abnormal LFTs
 with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of
 °SS 
 
 
 Methods
 
 Statistical analysis
 The statistical analysis included descriptive measures
 means standard deviations and ranges Comparison of
 results of patients with and without liver disease was
 done using t tests of continuous variables and Fishers
 exact test or x for categoric measures 
 
 
 
 Results
 Of the charts reviewed cases women and 
 men median age fulfilled EECC for °SS and were
 initially included for analysis Of the patients a 
 of them patients have had a salivary gland biopsy
 performed In all these patients the biopsy confirmed the
 diagnosis of syndrome All patients studied had
 objective evidence of °SS including keratoconjunctivitis
 sicca positive labial salivary gland biopsy 
 autoantibodies and or salivary gland hypofunction We
 excluded those patients without these objective criteria of
 °SS and also those who did not fulfill EECC criteria 
 The mean age at time of onset of disease was ± 
 years old and disease duration was years ± years
 mean ± range Liver function tests had been determined in
 patients and abnormal liver function tests were
 found in of the patients Further analysis
 was then undertaken in those patients in whom LFTs had been
 measured The clinical and laboratory characteristics of
 these patients are shown in Tables and 
 For these SS patients studied abnormal LFTs were more
 common than any other potential non exocrine features of
 SS Clinical evidence of liver disease defined in methods
 section was found in patients all of whom had
 abnormal liver function tests Two deaths occurred in the
 population studied both attributed to liver failure An
 additional patient required a liver transplant In all
 cases the diagnosis of °SS antedated the onset of liver
 disease or its diagnosis Markers of viral hepatitis 
 sought in patients were found only in Two patients
 carried the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus and one
 had antibodies to hepatitis C virus In a liver biopsy of a
 patient who lacked serological markers for hepatitis
 viruses hepatitis B virus was detected by 
 in situ hybridization 
 Risk factors for liver disease were identified in of
 the patients with abnormal liver function tests and are
 described in Table No association with tobacco use was
 found Only patients had documented evidence of tobacco
 consumption We found no significant differences in risk
 factors for abnormal liver function tests among patients
 with or without hepatic involvement Therefore in of
 the patients with sub clinical or clinical evidence of
 liver disease no clear explanation for the abnormal LFTs
 was found except for the association with °SS 
 The pattern of biochemical liver abnormalities was
 mainly hepatocellular defined as predominant increase of
 AST and or ALT in comparison with AP and or bilirubins in
 cases cholestatic defined as predominant increase in
 AP and or bilirubins compared with AST and or ALT in and
 mixed evidence of both cholestatic and hepatocellular
 damage in cases Abnormalities were persistent present
 on every occasion when measured more than once in 
 patients of those with abnormal LFTs intermittent
 presence of LFT abnormalities was not found in all
 determinations in and in one case there was
 only one determination of liver function tests The pattern
 of liver enzyme abnormalities is shown in Figure None of
 the patients with abnormal liver function tests had
 clinical evidence of muscle involvement that could explain
 the high levels of amino transferases Activity of CPK or
 aldolase was not elevated when measured in of the 
 patients with abnormal liver function tests 
 Anti mitochondrial antibodies AMA and anti smooth muscle
 antibodies ASMA were sought in patients with positive
 ASMA in 
 The association of abnormal liver function tests with
 other non exocrine features of °SS is shown in Figure 
 Patients with abnormal liver function tests were more
 likely to have lung kidney or hematological
 manifestations when compared to  patients without
 liver disease Presence of other non exocrine features of
 °SS was not influenced by prevalence of liver
 diseases 
 Regarding laboratory test results patients with liver
 disease were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation
 rate at some point during the course of their disease A
 positive anti ENA anti Ro anti Ro La and or anti RNP 
 was also associated with an increased prevalence of
 abnormal liver function tests Figure The sample was
 too small to determine whether a specific ENA was
 associated with liver disease Other markers of systemic
 inflammation or autoimmunity did not correlate with the
 presence or absence of LFT abnormalities 
 Liver biopsies done in patients disclosed post viral
 chronic active hepatitis cryptogenic cirrhosis 
 and one case each of post viral cirrhosis alcoholic
 hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis 
 
 
 Discussion
 In this group of   patients seen at a tertiary
 care center abnormal liver function tests were found to be
 a common non exocrine feature of °SS The prevalence of
 this association was found to be higher in our study than
 in other previous series The true
 prevalence could be even higher since liver enzyme profiles
 were not done in all patients The prevalence suggested in
 previous reports ranges from to but the definition
 of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific e g 
 hepatomegaly to well proven cases of liver disease 
 Denko in reported that of patients
 with SS had hepatosplenomegaly Other studies done
 in the s also confirmed hepatomegaly in   of
 patients with SS In Whaley reported liver
 disease in of patients with SS and mentioned an
 association with anti mitochondrial antibodies In
 Tsianos and co workers described SS patients with
 gastrointestinal complications called from a large cohort 
 only two patients had liver disease each with chronic
 active hepatitis Other studies have reported
 variable prevalence and different
 histopathological findings in liver biopsies ranging from
 cholestatic liver damage stage I primary biliary
 cirrhosis to chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis C
 virus 
 In our study liver disease was associated with other
 non exocrine manifestations of °SS specifically those
 affecting lung kidney and blood cells Those patients with
 serological evidence of systemic inflammation as shown by
 an elevated sedimentation rate were more likely to have
 liver test abnormalities Also the presence of a positive
 anti ENA correlated positively with hepatic disease An
 association of ENA response with liver disease has been
 described in children with autoimmune hepatitis where
 anti ENA positive patients demonstrated more severe liver
 test abnormalities than those who were anti ENA negative 
 In another study a of patients with various
 chronic liver diseases were found to be anti RNP positive 
 
 With etiopathogenesis of °SS still an open question 
 a possible role of hepatitis C virus HCV has drawn
 attention Recent studies have mentioned HCV incidence in
 patients with SS ranging from   
 Phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands
 with immunohistochemistry in patients with hepatitis C
 virus infection and or °SS has given conflicting results 
 Some reports mention that the salivary gland
 findings are strikingly similar in patients with liver
 disease associated with HCV infection than in those with
 °SS while others mention distinctive differences
 between both groups regarding focus score expression of
 surface markers in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary
 glands and in epithelial cells as well as differences in
 the degree of inflammation Transgenic mice
 models that carry the HCV envelope genes develop an
 exocrinopathy affecting salivary and lachrymal glands 
 Expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ
 between HCV infection and °SS Positive ENAs are rarely
 seen in HCV patients Also in most cases sicca symptoms
 are not present in individuals with HCV as compared with
 the °SS population Although the prevalence of viral
 hepatitis markers in our group of patients with liver
 disease was very low and did not account for most of the
 cases with abnormal liver function tests these markers
 were not sought in a small percentage of these patients It
 is important to note that HCV appears to account for a
 subgroup of patients with exocrine complaints in which half
 the cases might meet the definition for SS according to
 European and Manthorpe criteria However this subgroup is
 characterized by the absence of clinical manifestations
 observed in °SS and the absence of anti Ro and anti La 
 
 An aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and
 different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a
 mechanism for the damage seen in different organs in ° SS
 Since it has been suggested that the target tissue
 involved in the autoimmune histopathologic lesions of °SS
 might be the epithelium it is interesting that the
 findings in our study point to the association of liver
 disease with pulmonary and renal abnormalities all which
 are characterized by epithelial damage 
 Epithelial cells have been proposed to be active
 participants rather than passive targets in the chronic
 immune response in °SS but further studies are needed to
 establish the role of liver epithelial cells in the
 pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease including
 the analysis of HLA expression and cytokine secretion
 pattern in these cells 
 The co existence of liver disease and the presence of
 circulating AMAs in   patients sera has been
 pointed as an indicator that liver pathology might be
 autoimmune and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis
 In previous studies a pericholangial
 lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage I
 of primary biliary cirrhosis has been reported in °SS
 with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for AMA 
 In our review of cases we found predominance in
 hepatocellular liver damage rather than cholestatic
 disease which would argue against a PBC type of liver
 damage Other authors had proposed that SS associated with
 PBC should be considered a form of secondary SS that
 resembles more the  sicca complex  with exocrine features
 seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
 Limitations of the study come primarily from being a
 retrospective analysis Since the patients were studied in
 a tertiary care referral center the severity of the
 disease and the prevalence of the manifestations might be
 different from the general °SS population Furthermore in
 many cases   syndrome diagnosis had been sought
 because of otherwise unexplained non exocrine features 
 While we could not find an association between use of
 NSAIDS or other medications and prevalence of liver
 function tests abnormalities the study design did not
 allow us to exclude the possibility of over the counter
 OTC medication use that could have affected LFTs
 measurement Drug toxicity is certainly an important factor
 to be considered However given that most patients had
 persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of LFTs
 and that the use of hepatotoxic drugs was not elicited in
 the majority of patients with liver abnormalities a toxic
 effect of medications could not be established 
 
 
 Conclusions
 Based on the results of this study we consider that an
 evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver
 disease should be done in every patient with °SS 
 particularly if there is evidence of other non exocrine
 complications or serological evidence of systemic
 inflammation Although no other diagnosis explaining liver
 disease may be found the disorders for which treatment
 might be beneficial e g immunosuppressants for autoimmune
 hepatitis interferon alpha for viral hepatitis 
 ursodeoxycolic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis warrant
 a diligent search in all cases of °SS with abnormal liver

 Background
 Ecto Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases
 E NTPDases formerly called ecto ATPases hydrolyze
 nucleotides in the presence of divalent cations and are
 insensitive to inhibitors of P type F type and V type
 ATPases Three isoforms that differ in the ratio of
 ATPase ADPase activity are present on the cell surface 
 E NTPDase with a ratio of E NTPDase with a ratio
 of and E NTPDase with a ratio of   NTPDases are
 important in many physiological processes like cell
 motility adhesion nonsynaptic information transfer 
 secretion regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases 
 Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the NTPDases will
 help description of their physiological functions and
 development of strategies to regulate the functions of the
 enzymes 
 The catalytic mechanism of NTPDases is not known even
 though some basic facts of the catalysis have been
 established NTPDases do not form phosphorylated
 intermediates during catalysis a conclusion also supported
 by lack of vanadate sensitivity and Pi product inhibition 
 The catalytic reaction appears to be
 irreversible and no partial reactions have been observed 
 Divalent cations like Ca  or Mg  are required for
 activity and maximal activity is reached when the
 concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal
 The specific activities of NTPDases vary over a
 broad range from ten thousand units for potato apyrase to
 less than one hundred units for chicken gizzard ecto ATPase
 Sequence comparisons indicate that most of
 NTPDases contain five highly conserved regions apyrase
 conserved region ACR   ACR However the
 catalytic sites have not been identified although ACR and
 ACR have been implicated in    and γ phosphate binding 
 respectively 
 E NTPDase is also called CD as it was first
 described as an antigen present on activated B and T
 lymphocytes Residues of ACR to ACR of CD have been
 mutated to study the involvement of the ACR regions in
 catalysis E in ACR and S in ACR are required for
 catalytic function Substitution of H in ACR 
 converted CD into an ADPase in a quaternary structure
 dependent manner Mutation of W A in ACR 
 affected CD folding and translocation while mutation of
 W A in ACR increased ATPase activity but diminished
 ADPase activity Mutations of D and G of ACR 
 and D and G of ACR demonstrated that the nucleotide
 phosphate binding domains of NTPDases are similar to those
 present in the actin heat shock protein sugar kinase
 superfamily These results suggest that the
 conserved residues of the ACR to regions are involved in
 the catalytic mechanism of CD 
 The catalytic activity of CD is dependent on the
 presence of divalent cations Since the interactions of Ca
   and Mg   with proteins are difficult to study due to the
 lack of spectroscopic properties vanadyl V IV O  has
 been used as a probe of the ligands that compose Mg   Ca
   and Mn  binding sites of several proteins including
 carboxypeptidase S adenosylmethionine synthetase 
 pyruvate kinase and F 
  ATPase This cation
 specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites of
 several enzymes and in many cases serves as a functional
 cofactor Vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial
 coordination sites relative to the axis of the
 double bounded oxygen an arrangement that is similar to
 that for Ca  and Mg   As it is known that the 
 A and 
 g tensors derived from the EPR spectrum
 of bound VO  are a direct measure of the nature of the
 equatorial metal ligands binding of VO  to CD 
 could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of
 CD 
 Recently we reported that a recombinant soluble CD 
 capable of hydrolyzing both ATP and ADP was expressed and
 purified from insect cells Only one
 nucleotide binding site was identified on the purified
 soluble CD in the presence of Ca  when non hydrolysable
 nucleotide analogs were used In this report we
 characterized the signals that were obtained from bound VO
  when ATP or ADP was present at the catalytic site of the
 purified soluble CD The possible metal ligands for VO
   at the catalytic site are proposed and the catalytic
 mechanism is discussed 
 
 
 Results
 
 Nucleotidase activity of purified soluble CD with
 VO  as cofactor
 The ability of purified soluble CD to hydrolyze VO
  ATP is shown in Figure Soluble CD did not
 hydrolyze either ATP or ADP in the absence of VO   Fig 
 A When VO  was mixed with ATP at a ratio of the
 concentrations of both ADP and AMP increased and ATP
 decreased as the incubation time was prolonged Fig B 
 The ATPase activity of sCD with VO  was about of
 that with Ca  as a cofactor Vanadyl is unstable in
 aqueous solution at pH in the absence of chelator and
 will precipitate out of solution as VO OH 
 
 n The rate of precipitation depends
 on the abundance and affinity of the chelator This means
 that the actual VO  concentration was lower than mM 
 This result indicates that VO  can functionally
 substitute for Ca  as cofactor for sCD nucleotidase
 activity 
 
 
 Characterization of bound VO  ADPNP by
 CW EPR
 The parallel features of CW EPR spectrum of bound VO
  in the presence of ADPNP an ATP analog are shown in
 Figure a This spectrum shows V hyperfine splitting
 and the center of the parallel transitions from molecules
 with the V O bond oriented along the magnetic field A 
    g 
    which are strong enough to tell
 the nature of VO  equatorial ligands Of the
 eight transitions that result from the parallel oriented
 molecules the     
        
        
        
    and     
    transitions shown in the figures
 from left to right respectively do not overlap with
 perpendicular transitions The V hyperfine splitting
 spectra from molecules with V O bond perpendicular to the
 magnetic field A⊥ are much smaller and not shown here 
 The intensity of     
    peak is used as direct measurement
 of the amount of bound VO   since this peak is the most
 intense peak in the EPR spectrum that contains
 contribution only from A 
    but not A⊥ In this
 study the intensities of each bound VO   EPR feature
 were normalized to mg of protein 
 VO  bound as the VO   AMPPNP complex to sCD 
 produced a strong spectrum characterized by A 
    of MHz and g 
    of Fig b called species
 T Table The best fit of EPR species T to eq is one
 equatorial nitrogen from an amino group and three
 equatorial oxygen ligands from carboxyl or phosphate
 groups Table This result is consistent with AMPPNP
 binding strongly to a single site on sCD in the
 presence of metal 
 
 
 Characterization of EPR species from VO   AMPCP
 bound to sCD 
 Figure ashows the parallel features of the EPR
 spectrum of sCD bound VO   AMPCP Two sets of parallel
 transitions were observed and the derived A 
    and g 
    values are listed in Table One
 set had A 
    of MHz and g 
    of which is defined as
 species D Fig b The other set displayed A 
    of MHz and g 
    of which is called species
 D Fig c The intensity of species D accounted for
 of species T from bound VO   AMPPNP and the
 intensity of D accounted for of species T The
 intensity ratio of species D over D was 
 In order to distinguish species D from D the sample
 with VO   AMPCP bound to sCD was thawed and incubated
 at room temperature for minutes and the VO  EPR
 spectrum was collected again As shown in Figure aand
 b either A 
    or g 
    values for both species D and D 
 were changed The intensity of species D was not changed
 as it accounted for of the intensity of species T
 of the bound VO   AMPPNP However the intensity of
 species D was decreased dramatically and it accounted
 for only of the intensity of species T The
 intensity ratio of D over D increased about fold to
 become 
 There are two sets of equatorial ligands that can fit
 well the EPR species D according to Eq Table One
 set includes two equatorial oxygen from two water
 molecules one equatorial oxygen from a carboxyl group or
 phosphate and one equatorial nitrogen from an amino
 group The other set contains one equatorial oxygen from
 water and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups
 or phosphate The best fit for the EPR species D to eq 
 is one equatorial oxygen from a hydroxyl group and three
 equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate 
 
 
 EPR characteristics of sCD bound VO   ATP
 In order to capture the bound VO   EPR signal before
 the enzyme completely turned over sCD and VO   ATP
 were mixed on ice immediately transferred into the EPR
 tube and frozen The entire process took about 
 seconds The parallel portion of the collected VO   EPR
 spectrum is shown in Figure a VO   ATP complex bound
 to sCD produced an EPR spectrum with A 
    of MHz and g 
    of which corresponded to
 species D Fig b The signal intensity from the bound
 VO   nucleotide complex accounted only for of that
 of species T from bound non hydrolysable VO   ADPNP
 complex 
 The same sample made from mixing VO   ATP and sCD 
 was incubated at room temperature for minutes then
 the VO   EPR spectrum was generated as shown in Figures
 cand d The EPR parameters derived from this VO   EPR
 spectrum were MHz for A 
    and for g 
    respectively which is consistent
 with species D However the signal intensity decreased
 about fold compared to that obtained before room
 temperature incubation 
 
 
 Free VO  binding to sCD characterized by
 CD EPR
 Like other metals Ca  and Mg   free VO
  inhibited the nucleotidase activities of sCD at high
 concentration data not shown VO  in the absence of
 any nucleotides was added to sCD at molar ratio 
 The parallel transitions of bound VO   EPR spectrum are
 shown in Figure The features derived from the VO
   EPR spectrum were MHz for A 
    and for g 
    which was designed as species V
 Fig b The signal intensity of bound VO  accounted
 for of that from the bound VO   ADPNP complex 
 The best fit of equatorial ligands for species V
 according to eq is two equatorial oxygen from hydroxyl
 groups and another two equatorial oxygen from two water
 molecules 
 
 
 
 Discussion
 Vanadyl has been used to estimate the types of groups
 that serve as metal ligands in F 
  ATPase and other enzymes 
 because the g and A tensors of the V hyperfine
 couplings are approximately a linear combination of tensors
 from each type of group that contributes an equatorial
 ligand By studying the EPR spectra of bound VO
  in the presence of different nucleotides we show that
 the interaction of soluble CD with ATP is different from
 that with ADP 
 It is not surprising that VO  can functionally replace
 Ca  in the hydrolysis of both ATP and ADP by soluble CD 
 although the enzymatic activity is about of that with
 Ca  as the cofactor since F 
  ATPase also hydrolyzes ATP at a
 decreased rate when VO  replaces Mg   
 The EPR features of VO  are able to reveal some details
 about how CD hydrolyzes ATP and ADP A single EPR
 feature species T was observed when ADPNP a
 non hydrolyzable analog of ATP complexed with VO  was
 bound to sCD which is consistent with the presence of
 only one nucleotide binding site The g and A
 tensors derived from species T are and MHz
 respectively which can be fitted best with one amino group
 and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate
 groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound VO  on
 sCD In accordance with metal ATP complex coordination on
 other enzymes that hydrolyze ATP like F 
  ATPase the γ  and
   phosphate of ATP most likely bind to VO  while the third
 carboxyl group is contributed by a side chain of aspartate
 or glutamate of sCD It is not unusual for the ε amino
 group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes It
 has been reported that the amino group serves as one of VO
  equatorial ligands in CF 
  ATPase pyruvate kinase 
 AdoMet synthetase and carboxypeptidase 
 Thus one amino group from lysine one carboxyl group
 from aspartate or glutamate and two oxygens from the
 phosphates of ADPNP serve as the equatorial ligands of
 sCD bound VO  in the presence of ADPNP 
 In the presence of AMPCP bound VO  produced two EPR
 features species D and species D that are separated by
 about MHz As we have reported that sCD releases
 intermediate ADP before ADP is further cleaved during ATP
 hydrolysis sCD probably has two conformations
 that bind metal ADP complexes one is the conformation that
 releases the ADP intermediate and another that recruits
 intermediate ADP back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis
 to AMP However intact CD does not release intermediate
 ADP during ATP hydrolysis suggesting that there is only
 one ADP binding site on each CD monomer in the intact
 protein The two EPR species observed with VO
   AMPCP probably correspond to the two different
 conformations of bound ADP at the same catalytic site on
 sCD The signal intensity of the bound VO   AMPCP EPR
 spectrum indicates that species D is dominant over species
 D In order to further assign species D and D to the two
 different conformations two experiments were done Fig 
 Incubation of sCD with VO   AMPCP at room
 temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the
 intensity of species D while the signal intensity of
 species D remained unchanged These data indicate that VO
   AMPCP was released from the conformation corresponding
 to species D however the conformation corresponding to
 species D still had bound VO   AMPCP More evidence for
 two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the EPR
 spectra of bound VO   ATP No species T was found
 presumably because ATP was converted to ADP before the
 sample was frozen Only species D was observed and its
 intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged 
 We suggest that species D corresponds to the conformation
 that releases ADP as an intermediate product and species D 
 corresponds to the conformation that binds ADP as a
 substrate The lower signal intensities of species D and
 D compared to that of species T suggest that the affinity
 of sCD for ADP or its analog AMPCP is lower than that for
 the ATP analog ADPNP which is consistent with the result
 that only ATP analogs were detected on sCD 
 The calculated g 
    and A 
    values that best matched the
 experimental values for species D suggest that one
 hydroxyl group and three oxygens derived from carboxyl
 groups and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound
 VO   ADP Since the conformation corresponding to species
 D is found in the presence of ATP and is likely to be the
 conformation that releases bound VO    ADP it is likely
 that the VO   ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl
 groups When ADP is the substrate and generates
 species D one water molecule and a combination of three
 groups between carboxyl groups and phosphates serve as the
 equatorial ligands of bound VO  on sCD The probable
 combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species
 D is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since VO
  complexes ADP through two phosphates before VO   ADP is
 bound to the enzyme 
 The site directed mutagenesis studies on CD and other
 members of the CD family give some hints about the
 possible residues that serve as metal ligands at the
 catalytic site of sCD The changes of D on ACR E 
 on ACR D D in HB and S on ACR dramatically
 decrease both ATPase and ADPase activities of CD 
 Figure summarizes the possible coordination of Ca
  from the data of species T species D and species D in
 the different situations of sCD catalysis The catalytic
 base attack results in cleavage of the γ phosphate of ATP 
 and one carboxyl group replaces the γ phosphate as a metal
 ligand from species T to species D which is accompanied
 by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group S   
 This hydroxyl group S   probably interacts with the
 water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation
 corresponding to species D to hydrolyze ADP The constant
 carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of sCD 
 hydrolysis is likely contributed by D since it is close
 to S 
 The results presented here also provide an explanation
 to the free metal inhibition of CD catalytic activity 
 Free VO  binds to sCD through two hydroxyl groups and
 two water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other
 residues of sCD Once free VO  occupies the catalytic
 site the enzyme has to either release the metal or correct
 the conformation before the substrates are recruited
 properly 
 
 
 Conclusions
 VO  can functionally substitute for Ca  as a cofactor
 for sCD Four different EPR spectra are obtained for VO
  bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the
 absence of nucleotide The protein ligands for VO   in the
 presence of ATP are suggested to be carboxyl and amino
 groups while those in the presence of ADP are probably
 carboxyl and hydroxyl groups The mechanism of sCD
 catalysis is discussed These results will provide guides
 for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of
 NTPDases

 Kofi Annan the Secretary General of the United Nations recently called attention to
 the clear inequalities in science between developing and developed countries and to the
 challenges of building bridges across these gaps that should bring the United Nations and
 the world scientific community closer to each other Annan Mr Annan stressed the
 importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing
 countries asserting that  This unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates
 serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries but for
 development itself  Indeed Mr Annans sentiments have also been echoed recently by
 several scientists who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific
 output between the developing and already developed countries Gibbs May 
 Goldemberg Riddoch For example recent United Nations Educational Scientific 
 and Cultural Organization UNESCO estimates UNESCO indicate that in the
 developed countries accounted for some of the global investment in scientific research
 and development had approximately of the world researchers and produced approximately
 of all scientific and technical publications registered by the Science Citation Index
 SCI North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications
 produced annually with and respectively worldwide UNESCO 
 
 
 North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific
 publications produced annually 
 
 
 It is rather obvious that richer countries are able to invest more resources in science
 and therefore account for the largest number of publications It is also likely that there
 is a statistical bias on the part of the SCI as a bibliometric database since it
 represents North American and European publications far better than those of the rest of
 the world Gibbs May Alonso and Fernández Juricic Vohora and Vohora
 But is the disparity in scientific contributions between the developed and
 developing worlds actually remaining unchanged or even increasing as Mr Annan has
 implied  A closer look at the trends over the last decade reveals important advances in
 developing countries For example Latin America and China although representing 
 respectively only and of scientific publications worldwide have increased the
 number of their publications between and by and respectively which is a
 much higher percentage than the increments reached by Europe and industrial Asia
 The percentage of global scientific publications from North America actually
 decreased by over the same period UNESCO 
 
 
 Publishing Trends in the Americas
 Using the SCI databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information ISI as
 well as data compiled by the Red Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnología
 RICYT we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific
 publications between the developed world and the developing world from until 
 focusing on the Americas as a case study Not surprisingly there was a huge disparity in
 the number of publications from until with the United States contributing the
 lions share followed by Canada Latin America as a whole contributed
 only to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years RICYT
 
 The total number of publications however is not necessarily the best measure for
 assessing scientific productivity or technical advances May More relevant
 measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of
 publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research
 and development May The proportional change in the number of publications using
 as a comparison revealed that scientific publishing in Latin America increased the
 most rapidly in the Americas far outpacing the United States and Canada Figure 
 Further analyses correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money
 invested in research and development for each region also show that in contrast to both
 Canada and United States the trend in Latin America has been an increase in relative
 output throughout the s Figure Moreover when taking into account the amount of
 research money available to researchers Latin America actually out published the United
 States and Canada by the year Figure Although the cost of research is undoubtedly
 cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries overhead and
 other work standards these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number
 of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in Latin America 
 particularly from until Figure 
 Other relative indicators of scientific productivity such as the number of publications
 picked up by the SCI in relation to the number of scientists in a particular country also
 demonstrate that such developing regions as Latin America are making substantial
 contributions to science despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic
 product GDP invested in science in Latin America throughout this  year period was only
 of the amount invested in United States RICYT Indeed this scientific
 productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science
 itself as compared with the GDP of Latin America as a whole In fact Albornoz 
 concluded that as a group Latin America could afford to invest a much higher proportion
 of its resources in scientific research and development Latin American investment in
 research and development represented only of the regional GDP in a very weak
 effort compared with that of the United States and Canada 
 Among Latin American countries there is a high degree of variability in publication
 rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology Some countries have
 performed particularly well For example Uruguay Chile Panama and Cuba averaged 
 respectively and publications per million dollars of research and
 development investment in the years studied which is notoriously high compared with
 United States and even Canada RICYT Other countries such as Costa
 Rica Cuba Brazil and Chile have invested a much greater proportion of their GDP in
 research and development than the other countries of this region Albornoz 
 
 
 Why has the number of publications per dollar invested in research and
 development been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in United States and
 Canada 
 
 
 
 
 Explaining the Increase in Publishing Productivity in Latin America
 One potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in Latin America
 is that scientific development during the s was particularly strong for many countries
 of this region Indeed this would explain the rapid rise in the number of publications in
 Latin America compared with the relatively flat increases in the United States and Canada 
 which were publishing just as well at the beginning of the decade A potentially more
 important question however is why the number of publications per dollar invested in
 research and development has been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in the
 United States and Canada This pattern could be the result of a variety of factors none of
 which are mutually exclusive It is possible that publishing in international journals as a
 measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in Latin America Increased
 funding to the most productive scientists from the national science development programs
 might have been an important stimulus International cooperation resulting in more
 scientific collaborations among scientists in Latin America Europe and the United States
 may also have increased the relative number of publications in Latin America In contrast 
 the decreasing trends in the number of publications per investment dollar in Canada and
 United States could reflect a trend towards more costly research in larger scientific
 programs 
 
 
 Scientific Impact from Latin America
 What exactly is the relative impact of such developing regions as Latin America on the
 scientific community  We used SCI data to examine the proportion of publications in
 the area of ecology including the fields of evolutionary biology conservation biology 
 and global change biology between and in both the two top general science
 journals 
 Nature and 
 Science with impact factors of and respectively and in
 the top ecological journals with impact factors of   ISI a We credited
 a region with a publication if any of the authors were affiliated with institutions from
 that region Thus more than one region would receive credit for a single publication if
 that publication had been written by multiple authors from institutions of different
 regions 
 For the top ecological journals the American subcontinents of South Central and
 North America accounted for of the publications worldwide Within the Americas 
 however Latin America represented only while Canada and United States accounted 
 respectively for and of the top ecological publications When we examined the
 data as contributions to the top ecological journals impact factors   versus
 the top   impact factors   the Latin American countries contributed nearly
 twice as many publications to journals in the second category in the top   compared
 with in the top These findings suggest that publications from such developing
 regions as Latin America are falling short of reaching the top journals In contrast the
 United States contributed somewhat more publications to the top journals than the
 top   journals The difference in the proportion of publications contributed by
 the United States to the top and top journals was even more pronounced when we
 examined it in respect to worldwide publications In this case the United States
 contributed of the publications to the top journals and only of the publications
 to the top   journals 
 Interestingly the proportion of publications from Latin America the United States and
 Canada across all subject areas in 
 Science and 
 Nature were nearly identical to those of the top ecological journals 
 In 
 Science and 
 Nature Latin America had of the publications within the Americas
 versus in the top ecological journals whereas the United States and Canada had 
 versus and versus respectively These similarities suggest that the Latin
 American researchers are not shying away from the two top ranked general science journals 
 However publishing in 
 Science and 
 Nature was not enough to gain prominence as evidenced by the number of
 citations of these researchers The latest list of the most cited researchers in
 ecology and environmental sciences emphasizes the overwhelming contributions of authors
 from North America and Europe ISI b No researcher working in a Latin
 American institution was included in the remaining Overall these data indicate that
 the scientific output in the field of ecology in Latin America is having a relatively low
 impact in the international scientific community and is underrepresented in the top
 international journals despite its robust productivity as measured by the number of
 publications per researcher funding amount Similar findings were also reported for Asia
 Swinbanks et al and thus could be a general phenomenon in the developing world 
 Although there are outstanding scientific researchers in the developing world who
 independently are making important contributions to the international scientific community 
 they are the exception Why in general do Latin American scientists often fail to reach
 the top journals or become amongst the most cited researchers in their fields  One
 possibility is that the main research agendas between both regions are somewhat different
 and that the top journals which are published in the developed world respond more to the
 scientific mainstream of the developed regions This is not to suggest any sort of
 conspiracy but rather it implies that the perception of the most important science is
 linked to the region and that because the major funding agencies as well as most prominent
 journals share a similar economic region they also share the same perception of what
 science is most interesting to them Another consideration is that more local journals from
 developed regions are listed by the SCI than similar journals from developing regions
 Gibbs Consequently there are more high profile regional publication opportunities
 available to scientists from the developed region whereas much of the research published
 locally in the developing world is overlooked But it takes more than publishing good
 papers to become a highly cited scientist It requires attending international meetings and
 introducing novel research findings in multiple scientific forums Funding these
 activities however requires a greater proportion of research money being spent on
 meetings for researchers in the developing compared with the developed world 
 
 
 A Long Road Yet to Travel
 The positive trends in scientific productivity in Latin America should not be
 misinterpreted as a reason to be unconcerned about the existing gap highlighted by Mr 
 Annan There are many compelling reasons for the push to increase scientific input from the
 developing world Goldemberg Annan One is that science as a discipline would
 benefit from the contributions of many disparate groups around the world rather than being
 dominated by two geographic regions Many scientific problems could be solved much more
 readily with the cooperation and scientific insight of scientists from developing regions 
 Climate change and biodiversity research for example urgently need the scientific input
 from those developing regions that are so important for these global processes It is also
 critical for the developing world to promote through research and publications those
 areas of concern that are having a proportionally greater scientific and social impact upon
 them There are now examples in which research on priority areas for the developing nations
 can actually become pioneering work in areas neglected by the research agenda of the
 industrialized world This has been the case for research on renewable energy sources in
 Brazil Goldemberg and biomedical sciences in Cuba Castro Díaz Balart These
 examples are important not only for those regions of the developing world but are also in
 themselves scientific innovations that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the
 world 
 
 
 Climate change and biodiversity research urgently need the scientific
 input from those developing regions that are so important for global processes 
 
 
 Although the evidence presented here demonstrates that there is a long way to go before
 developing countries contribute a more equitable share to the international scientific
 community there are also reasons to be optimistic The relative increase in the number of
 publications especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and
 development demonstrates that many developing countries are heading in the right
 direction The extremely high scientific productivity of many developing nations corrected
 for and despite the rather limited availability of funds suggests that increased funding
 to the sciences will be an excellent investment by developing nations in terms of
 publications as a measure of scientific output particularly if these publications can
 target the journals that have the greatest impact Although there may still be a long road
 to travel we feel optimistic that the bridges mentioned by Mr Annan are slowly being
 built 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 There is a much quoted saying attributed to the epidemiologist Geoffrey Rose  A large
 number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases than a small number
 exposed to a very high risk  This is true for many individual risk factors such as salt
 intake linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease and speeding on the
 highway linked to injuries and accidents Does it apply to many other global health
 risks  The study by Anthony Rodgers and colleagues suggests that it does 
 To develop effective health policies one must understand the existing health risks and
 disease burdens On a worldwide scale this is a tough challenge The Global Burden of
 Disease Database maintained by the World Health Organization WHO collects data from
 countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco malnutrition childhood abuse 
 unsafe sex childbirth and cholesterol levels as well as on disease burdens for example
 depression blindness and diarrhea A large group of scientists from all over the world
 has developed a framework to analyze these data To compare different risks or burdens 
 they calculate disability adjusted life years or DALYs the number of healthy life years
 lost because of a particular disease or risk factor 
 Rodgers and colleagues used data from the WHO database for risk factors and from 
 epidemiological subregions of the world to calculate the proportion of
 risk factor attributable disease burden in different population subgroups defined by age 
 sex and exposure level For being underweight in childhood for example the leading risk
 factor for global loss of healthy life they found that only of the disease burden
 occurred in severely underweight children the rest occurred in those only moderately
 underweight The relative risks for the moderately underweight are much lower but the
 number of children in that category is so large that the total attributable burden amounted
 to almost two thirds of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor 
 The analysis confirms and extends to a global level previous research showing that many
 major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels not just among
 individuals exposed to high levels of risk It also points to risk factors that are
 particularly prevalent among specific populations and age groups and for which highly
 targeted interventions could be effective 
 Despite numerous caveats and limitations of studies like this one such analyses are
 essential aids in guiding the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life
 years lost to premature death and disability 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 Introduction
 The concept of lung fibroblasts as effector cells in the
 pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF has
 recently evolved Lung fibroblasts respond 
 in vitro to inflammatory cytokines
 by producing growth factors and collagen resulting in
 fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix
 deposition In addition activated lung
 fibroblasts have been shown to produce large amounts of
 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 
 in vitro and hence these cells may
 also have a role as effector inflammatory cells 
 This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic
 factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung
 fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target
 cells via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms perpetuating
 the fibrotic process 
 Prostanoids are important regulators of fibroblast
 function Prostaglandin PG E 
 is thought to have antifibrotic
 properties 
 in vitro but also can have
 proinflammatory effects both 
 in vivo and 
 in vitro Thromboxane
 TX A 
 increases proliferation and DNA and
 RNA synthesis in several cell types including fibroblasts
 and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells 
 Conversely prostacyclin PGI 
 decreases smooth muscle cell
 proliferation and collagen synthesis 
 Many cell types including lung fibroblasts contain
 cyclooxygenase COX a proximal enzyme in prostanoid
 production and can generate prostanoids It has
 been previously reported that IPF lung fibroblasts have
 decreased COX  expression compared to normal lung
 fibroblasts and hence have decreased PGE 
 production Because of
 these findings and the fact that PGs are important
 fibroblast regulators we sought to investigate whether
 abnormalities in COX  expression could be associated with
 an altered balance between profibrotic and antifibrotic
 PGs We hypothesized that fibroblasts from the lungs of
 patients with IPF HF IPF have an altered PG balance
 compared to normal lung fibroblasts HF NL This
 phenotypical abnormality could be an important factor in
 the pathogenesis of IPF 
 
 
 Materials and methods
 
 Primary lung fibroblasts
 Fibroblasts from the lungs of seven patients males 
 with IPF HF IPF were harvested a from excised lung at
 the time of lung transplantation b during an autopsy
 performed within hours from death or c during open or
 transbronchial lung biopsies at the time of diagnosis Of
 the seven patients five subjects had advanced lung
 fibrosis and were receiving prednisone ±
 immunosuppressive agents patients were at an earlier
 stage of their disease and were not receiving
 immunosuppressive drugs The mean age of the patients was
 range   HF NL were cultured from five human
 lungs that arrived at our transplant center with the
 intention of being used for transplantation but for
 various reasons could not be transplanted these were
 macroscopically and microscopically normal The cells
 were harvested and cultured as per the protocol described
 by Kumar 
 et al Briefly lung
 tissue sections were finely cut with sterile scissors and
 incubated with serum free DMEM containing trypsin DNAse
 and collagenase for min The procedure was repeated
 twice and the supernatants were pooled and cultured in
 one mm plate and incubated at °C in a CO 
 humidified atmosphere Culture
 medium DMEM with fetal bovine serum FBS and
 penicillin streptomycin was replaced three times per
 week and fibroblasts were passed split at the time
 they became confluent On passage the cells were
 resuspended in ml of DMEM with FBS and DMSO and
 frozen at   °C For each experiment described below the
 cells were thawed cultured and passed at least once All
 the experiments were conducted with cells at passages 
 to 
 
 
 Inducible cyclooxygenase COX   expression and
 eicosanoid production
 COX  activity was determined by measuring PGE 
  keto PGF 
 α stable PGI 
 metabolite TXB 
 stable TXA 
 metabolite and PGF 
 α production in stimulated
 fibroblasts HF IPF n   and HF NL n   were
 brought to > confluency in mm plates and then
 placed on serum free DMEM for hours to render them
 quiescent Fibroblasts were then incubated in DMEM with
 FBS alone or in the same medium with IL    ng ml 
 for hours At the end of the incubation period the
 supernatant was aspirated and fresh media containing 
 μM of arachidonic acid was added to the plates After 
 min of incubation the supernatant was collected and saved
 at   °C for later eicosanoid analysis The cells were
 then resuspended and divided into two aliquots which
 were used for RNA and protein extractions respectively 
 The above experiments were repeated in HF IPF n   and
 HF NL n   using serum free media conditions 
 Prostanoids were measured by modified stable isotope
 dilution assays that used gas chromatography negative
 ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry as previously
 described Briefly deuterium labeled internal
 standards of PGE 
 PGF 
 α TXB 
 and  keto PGF 
 α were added to the supernatants with
 isopropyl alcohol Isopropyl alcohol was removed by
 evaporation under nitrogen After acidification to pH
 the samples were extracted on preconditioned C  
 PrepSep columns Fisher Scientific Fair Lawn NJ and
 eluted with ethyl acetate The extract was then converted
 to a pentafluorobenzyl ester by treatment with a mixture
 of pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile and
 disopropylethylamine at room temperature for min 
 After evaporation of reagents the residue was subjected
 to TLC plates using the solvent system
 chloroform ethanol vol vol for PGF 
 α and TXB 
 and ethyl acetate methanol 
 vol vol for  keto PGF 
 α and PGE 
 Then PGF 
 α was converted to trimethylsilyl
 ether derivative by treatment with N O bis
 trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide and
 dimethylformamide The methoxime derivative of TXB 
 PGE 
 and  keto PGF 
 α was made by treatment with 
 methoxamine hydrochloride in pyridine at °C for min 
 followed by evaporation of the pyridine addition of
 water and extraction with ethyl acetate Derivatization
 was completed by formation of the trimethylsilyl
 derivatives by treatment with N O bis trimethylsilyl 
 trifluoroacetamide and pyridine Eicosanoids were
 quantified by measuring the ratio of the intensity of
 ions m z   for PGF 
 α m z   for TXB 
 and  keto PGF 
 α and m z   for PGE 
 An analytical blank for each of
 these products was determined by measuring the amount of
 nondeuterated material detected after extracting and
 analyzing ml of saline to which the deuterium labeled
 internal standards had been added

 Discussion
 Several factors modulate fibroblast proliferation and
 collagen production including mitogenic cytokines e g 
 transforming growth factor   TGF  platelet derived
 growth factor PDGF basic fibroblast growth factor
 bFGF eicosanoids i e PGE 
 TXB 
 and PGI 
 and antifibrogenic cytokines e g 
 IFN γ It is very likely that a complex
 interaction among these factors exists in the tissue repair
 process and it is possible that pathologic fibrosis as in
 IPF results from phenotypical alterations in fibroblasts
 that affect the  normal  interaction of these factors 
 Our results show that stimulation of primary cultures of
 human lung fibroblasts with the proximal cytokine IL   
 upregulates COX  protein and mRNA expression to a similar
 degree in normal and IPF fibroblasts TXA 
 production tended to be greater in IPF
 than in normal fibroblasts at baseline when stimulated
 with IL    this difference became statistically
 significant The ratio of PGI 
 to TXA 
 metabolites was lower in IPF
 fibroblasts at baseline and with IL    stimulation The
 above results suggest that a decreased PGI 
 TXA 
 ratio could be a phenotypic alteration
 present in IPF fibroblasts resulting in a loss of their
 capacity to autoregulate proliferation and extracellular
 matrix production 
 The effects of PGs on cell proliferation and collagen
 production have been widely studied in different cell types
 TXA 
 has been studied extensively because
 of its apparent role in atherosclerosis due to its
 prothrombotic and mitogenic activities on vascular smooth
 muscle cells These mitogenic effects are
 potentiated by growth factors In vascular
 smooth muscle cells TXA 
 stimulates synthesis of bFGF and
 increases the expression of the proto oncogenes 
 c fos 
 c myc and 
 egr  which are associated with
 entry into the cell growth cycle In addition TXA 
 increases proliferation of fibroblasts
 and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells 
 
 On the other hand PGI 
 decreases vascular smooth muscle cell
 proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycane
 synthesis via activation of adenylyl cyclase and
 subsequent production of cAMP Betaprost an analog
 of PGI 
 decreases procollagen I and III mRNA
 expression in cardiac fibroblasts These effects
 may counteract the profibrotic effects seen with TXA 
 and it is possible that an alteration
 of a  normal  physiologic balance between PGI 
 and TXA 
 could increase tendency towards
 fibrogenesis 
 It is important to mention that our experiments were
 conducted at similar passage levels passage to in
 both groups since senescence of fibroblasts is associated
 with a shift from the biosynthesis of PGI 
 to TXA 
 It is possible that the
 difference seen in our study between HF IPF and HF NL could
 result from comparing fibroblasts of different ages HF IPF
 might have been harvested from fibrotic lesions where
 fibroblasts had previously undergone a greater number of
 cell divisions than HF NL obtained from nonfibrotic lungs 
 Although this is a possibility the age related shift in PG
 production has only been shown at very high cell passages
 and has not been documented 
 in vivo 
 We also found that both HF IPF and HF NL had similar PGE
 
 production at baseline and a similar
 increase when stimulated with IL    PGE 
 can decrease fibroblast proliferation
 and collagen synthesis and increase collagen degradation 
 
 Recent reports suggesting decreased COX  expression and
 PGE 
 production in IPF fibroblasts have
 received significant attention In our study
 we found that both COX  protein expression and PGE 
 production were upregulated to a
 similar degree in IPF and normal lung fibroblasts We
 believe that differences in methodology and patient
 selection may explain the discrepancies with other studies 
 Vancheri and collaborators found that
 TNF α stimulated fibrotic lung fibroblasts had decreased
 COX  expression and PGE 
 production but they further showed
 that these findings were a result of decreased expression
 of TNF α receptors The latter finding would argue against
 a primary defect in COX  expression since no other
 stimulus other than TNF α was tested In another study 
 Keerthisingam 
 et al reported that fibrotic
 lung fibroblasts had decreased COX  expression and PGE 
 production in response to TGF 
 stimulation This study differed from ours in that a
 different stimulus was used Of significance is the fact
 that the COX  gene is known to be NF κB dependent and
 IL    but not TGF  is a potent inducer of NF κB
 activation Hence the pathway involved in the induction of
 the COX  gene by IL    and TGF  may be different 
 Furthermore a significant proportion of the fibroblasts
 used in the study by Keerthisingam 
 et al were obtained from
 patients with systemic sclerosis which makes their
 fibroblast population more heterogeneous 
 Wilborn 
 et al also reported a
 decreased production of PGE 
 by IL    stimulated IPF fibroblasts 
 due to decreased COX  expression There is a
 possibility that patient selection may have differed
 between the two studies However we feel certain that the
 diagnostic accuracy of our patient population was high due
 to the fact that out of a total of IPF subjects
 included in our study underwent lung transplantation with
 confirmatory pathology results consistent with IPF The
 other subjects had biopsy proven IPF In addition our
 results were similar when comparing lung fibroblasts
 obtained from subjects with advanced stage IPF with those
 of subjects at an earlier stage of their disease who had
 received no therapy Although the reasons for our different
 results are unclear the fact that we found similar COX  
 expression and PGE 
 production in normal and IPF lung
 fibroblasts suggests that loss of COX  expression is not a
 universal characteristic of fibroblasts cultured from the
 lungs of subjects with IPF 
 
 
 Conclusion
 We have found that fibroblasts cultured from normal and
 IPF human lungs have a significant and similar induction of
 the COX  enzyme when stimulated with IL    but that IPF
 fibroblasts produced more thromboxane and had a
 significantly lower prostacyclin thromboxane ratio We
 hypothesize that the lower PGI 
 TXA 
 ratio seen in HF IPF may be a
 phenotypic alteration that plays a role in the pathogenesis
 of IPF

 a brief History
 Prehistoric man in Asia Minor now modern Turkey or Greece
 could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint
 silhouette of land Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that
 were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands 
 marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring 
 Around b c the Phoenicians set out from what is now
 Iran to explore their surroundings They eventually reached the
 islands and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part
 of the Aegean Sea An important early material obsidian was
 discovered on the island of Milos Obsidian is a hard vitreous
 volcanic rock which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and
 stabbing The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area
 remained popular with early travelers 
 The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come
 together as early as b c and were already in place by the late
 Bronze Age c b c The major changes were not to daily tasks
 and routines but to the political power base which changed regularly
 and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages 
 Cycladic Culture
 At around b c a sophisticated culture evolved in the
 Cyclades islands The distinctive sculpted marble figures of the era
 are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs You will find
 original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the
 Cyclades although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on
 Paros The people farmed and fished on the dawning of the Bronze Age
 in b c they began to work with metals The Cycladic culture was
 influenced by societies in the east importing the pottery wheel from
 Mesopotamia They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local
 marble 
 The Minoans and the Myceneans
 Farther south in Crete the Minoan culture developed after
 b c into the most significant of its age spreading its influence
 throughout the region by trade and diplomacy Santorini Thira the
 next major island north was heavily influenced by Crete and the
 settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time The magnificent
 frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present but
 the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the
 sophistication of the culture here 
 Around b c a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini
 destroyed not only Akrotiri   under feet of ash and pumice   but the
 whole Minoan civilization Massive tidal waves swept over Crete and
 other parts of the Mediterranean smashing buildings and drowning many
 thousands of people 
 In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval the Aegean
 Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans at around 
 b c who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland 
 The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer not to
 trade Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by
 Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad 
 The Rise of Athens
 The Dorians who came overland from northern Europe 
 conquered the Mycenaeans They were a barbaric race and their custody
 of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word
 was forgotten and art disappeared They held sway over islands off the
 northern Greek coast but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea
 routes south of the area trade continued as usual At the same time 
 city states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland 
 Athens became the most powerful heralding the start of the classical
 Greek period However Greece was not yet a country each city state
 was self governing and autonomous 
 The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean helped
 by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements
 such as Carthage a Greek city on the African coast of the
 Mediterranean Culture and the arts flourished once again Athletic
 prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in b c 
 to promote friendly competition Homer wrote his epic works on Chios 
 and lyrical poetry was much admired particularly the work of the poets
 Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos 
 The preeminent islands of this era were Delos a sacred
 island and center of religion ruled by Athens Samos ruled by the
 tyrant Polycrates and Naxos whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major
 building projects Archaeology shows that during this time societies
 lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement
 inland 
 The Persian Wars
 As Athens rose in influence and power in the West it was
 matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire From a power
 base in Anatolia the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and
 set their sights on the Cyclades In b c they captured sacred
 Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos The island communities were
 undecided about which side to back for a time Paros and Andros
 contributed to the Persian armory while others supported Athens The
 two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and
 Salamis in b c The Persians were defeated and Athens duly
 punished the islands that had turned against it 
 Following its victory Athens introduced the concept of a
 mutual protection alliance a kind of NATO of the ancient world 
 Several islands and Greek city states agreed to work together and
 created a treasury to fund their plans which was held on the island of
 Delos The alliance became known as the Delian League Although there
 were minor internal wrangles the league controlled the Aegean and the
 greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b c Later in
 b c the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were
 used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and
 temples of the Classical Age 
 In b c Athens began a war with its neighbor and
 league member Sparta Although the islands saw little action as the
 war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power 
 Before the end of the war in b c many islands had already
 transferred their allegiance to the victors who were led by Philip II
 of Macedon He was followed in b c by his son Alexander the Great 
 one of the most remarkable leaders in history His rise to power
 ushered in the Hellenistic period 
 Hellenistic and Roman Periods
 When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east
 as India the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes 
 Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire Following
 Alexanders death his lands were divided among his generals Much of
 the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies along with Egypt 
 Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan 
 Although in b c Mithradates made a swift and
 successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands 
 the next major power change brought influence from the West The Greek
 Hellenistic Empire was gradually and peacefully absorbed into the
 Roman Empire 
 The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity
 The Romans ruled a pagan empire but the Aegean had an
 important influence on the early development of Christianity In a d  
 St John arrived on Patmos a small rocky island in the Dodecanese 
 as a political prisoner It was here that he wrote what was to become
 the final book of the New Testament the Book of Revelation It wasnt
 until a d however when the newly converted Emperor Constantine
 made Byzantium renamed Constantinople capital of his Eastern Empire
 that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek
 life 
 The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well fortified
 cities but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by
 waves of invaders In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen
 Muslims a new potent religious force from the East the Byzantine army
 forcefully enlisted the men of the islands Disease took a further
 toll By the time of the Crusades many of the Aegean islands had been
 practically depopulated 
 As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first
 millennium Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter
 the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith 
 Unfortunately their zeal was not matched by their discrimination The
 crusaders swept through the l and of Byzantium slaughtering Christians
 as well as Muslims civilians as well as soldiers Constantinople was
 taken by Crusader forces in and they stripped the city of manyof
 its finest treasures   which now grace the public buildings of
 Venice   although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was
 transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell 
 While Byzantine land was being divided there was no one in
 control of the seas so pirates raided towns on many of the islands To
 counter this the populations moved from their homes on the coast and
 built settlements inland out of sight of the raiding parties This
 created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port
 skala which serves an inland settlement or chora making it easier to
 protect the island from attack 
 The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful
 European noblemen many of whom were Genoese or Venetian such as Marco
 Sanudo on Naxos The noblemen had free rein to create their own
 fiefdoms The Venetians fortified their main towns   Naxos Town and
 Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this   creating labyrinths of
 narrow alleys and cul de sacs that were designed to confuse and to
 demoralize invaders The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean
 Islands which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and
 trade 
 After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 
 Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land The Knights of St 
 John a holy military force made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the
 Dodecanese They began the process of building their strong citadels 
 and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands However they had
 not seen the last of their Muslim foe A force was gaining strength in
 the east to threaten their new bases 
 The Coming of the Ottoman Turks
 The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east 
 taking land in what is now Turkey By the end of the th century they
 began their first raids on the Aegean Islands In they took
 Constantinople and immediately made it their capital renaming it
 Istanbul 
 They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of
 St John and after an unsuccessful siege in they finally ejected
 the knights from the Dodecanese in In they wrested Chios
 from the Genoese bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands 
 but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or
 more   Tinos was the last to fall in The Ottomans brought new
 influences to the islands that they controlled forming a large empire
 that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean 
 Toward Greek Independence
 However a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula
 against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state In 
 Russia came to aid the Greeks defined by their Orthodox religion
 rather than by historical geographical boundaries declaring war on
 the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 
 Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of
 Antiparos 
 Although this attempt was unsuccessful the campaign for a
 Greek state continued into the th century and began to grow in
 strength The Aegean Islands played their part Lesvos Chios and
 Samos lay in the important shipping lanes and patriots began
 disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic In return the Turks violently put
 down every insurrection including the massacre on Chios when 
 people were slaughtered 
 The Ottoman Empire was weakening however and in the
 peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time 
 The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this
 new state A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout
 the Aegean thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the
 disparate Orthodox populations 
 The Twentieth Century
 A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the
 th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire The
 Turks lost a short war with Italy and were forced to relinquish the
 Dodecanese islands to the Italians Greece took this opportunity to
 absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add
 Macedonia to its mainland territories 
 Following this debacle the Ottomans then allied themselves
 to Germany in the World War I losing more territory with the defeat of
 the Germans in that war Greece was handed a strip of land along the
 western coast of Asia Minor which for over years had had a
 substantial Greek population Greece moved in to administer the land 
 but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part
 of greater Greece 
 In Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers 
 and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support He
 promised a modern state for his people but as the situation became
 volatile civil strife broke out in Turkish cities and those
 considered Greek were victims of threats and violence Many had to
 leave their birthplaces fleeing to Lesvos Chios and Samos the
 Greek ruled islands just offshore Thousands of people arrived with
 little more than the clothes they wore putting great strain on the
 resources of the islands Finally Greece was ousted from its new
 territory in Asia Minor which became part of the new Turkish
 state 
 Greece attempted to stay out of World War II but Mussolini
 saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire His forces made
 a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands 
 including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town but
 they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population
 against them Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the
 islands 
 After the war in the Dodecanese islands finally
 became part of the Greek nation But the country was politically
 fragmented with arguments between monarchists and republicans right
 and left and tension escalated into civil war The struggle bypassed
 most of the islands although there was fierce fighting on Samos Even
 after the fighting stopped more than a decade later the country was
 not stable 
 At the same time the massive growth in air and road
 transport saw shipping decline in importance The Aegean Islands which
 for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes became
 the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of
 several islands came close to collapse 
 In the military took the reins of power in Athens 
 and until the  Colonels held sway with a repressive and brutal
 regime Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty
 and terror and many made new homes in the United States and Australia 
 The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism and Greece
 along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern
 Europeans escaping their damp cool summers 
 In Greece joined the European Common Market now the
 European Union Since this time membership has been of great monetary
 benefit to the country The EU has given large subsidies to develop
 Greeces infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient
 monuments 
 Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands 
 and road systems have been expanded and i’m proved Private investment
 has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible 
 Politically the s have been relatively quite times for
 the islands although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas
 Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused
 consternation within conservative Greek society 
 As the Balkans flared to war once again Greek nationalism
 has stirred and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the
 land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers Whether
 this will ever happen remains to be seen but perhaps the aid offered
 by Greece to Turkey after s devastating earthquake is a sign that
 the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to
 diminish 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 A Brief History
 Jerusalems recorded history begins with its mention in
 Egyptian court records years ago but there had been human
 settlements here for centuries probably millennia before that At the
 beginning of the second millennium b c Jerusalem was a Canaanite
 mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route far less important than
 biblical cities such as Hazor Megiddo Beth Shean and Shechem The
 earliest name associated with the city Ur usalim perhaps meant  city
 of Shalim or  founded by Shalim  Scholars speculate that Shalim
 might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace for the name
 resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for  peace shalom and
 salaam respectively If true this is an ironic name for a city that
 would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places
 on the face of the earth 
 Biblical Jerusalem
 In the Bible Genesis   records that Abraham visited
 the city of  Salem in approximately b c and was blessed by the
 citys ruler Melchzedik who offered him bread and wine The city is
 not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet
 warrior King David who captured the city from the Jebusites in about
 b c The Bible describes how Davids soldiers conquered Jerusalem
 by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the
 city by surprise Warrens Shaft part of a Canaanite water system
 discovered by th century archaeologists and open to visitors might
 be the very tunnel infiltrated by Davids army 
 Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not
 allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel David made it the
 capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented
 artisans dedicated priests magical poets and musicians and the most
 formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city He
 also brought the Ark of the Covenant the portable tabernacle
 containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai to the
 Spring of Gihon just outside the walls of Jerusalem There the Ark
 rested until it was placed in the Temple built in approximately 
 b c on Mt Moriah the high point at the northern end of the city 
 The Temple today known as the  First Temple was completed
 by Davids son and successor King Solomon According to biblical
 tradition although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully
 assembled its building materials he was deemed unworthy of
 constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his
 hands At the Temples dedication Solomon addressed his God   the
 Heavens even the Heaven of the Heavens cannot contain Thee how much
 less this House that I have built  
 The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt 
 Moriah on which it stood where Abraham was called to sacrifice his
 son Isaac Along with this splendid house of worship Solomon built a
 royal palace mansions for his wives temples for the foreign gods
 worshipped by the princesses he had married and towers for the defense
 of the capital Under the wise reign of Solomon the city flourished as
 the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea
 and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia The Temple and
 royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with
 cedar from Lebanon the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon
 have captivated readers of the Bible for almost years But with
 his death the empire collapsed and the Israelite kingdom was divided
 into two separate impoverished often warring nations Israel with
 its capital at Shechem in the north ruled by a series of northern
 dynasties and the smaller kingdom of Judah with its capital at
 Jerusalem from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule The Bible
 tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms
 aroused the fury of the great Prophets 
 In b c the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed
 Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem Thanks to King
 Hezekiahs hidden water tunnel the city narrowly escaped destruction 
 The end of Davids dynasty came in b c when Nebuchadnezzar King
 of Babylon invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem When it fell the
 Temple and all the buildings were burned The people of the
 once glorious city were forced into an exile known as  the Babylonian
 Captivity 
 In time the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the
 Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in b c The city
 was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians but rebuilding
 was slow work The Second Temple was finished in b c but much of
 the city still lay in ruins 
 Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in
 b c under Alexander the Great and subsequently to his
 Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian
 Seleucids When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism Jews led by Judah
 Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in b c and against
 all odds restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem 
 The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of
 pagan sacrifices the eight day celebration of Hanukkah Feast of
 Dedication commemorates their victory The Hasmonean dynasty 
 descendants of the Maccabee family ruled an independent Jewish
 Commonwealth that stretched from the Negev to the Galilee Jerusalem
 grew surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside
 the Jaffa Gate The Hasmoneans ruled until Pompeys Roman legions
 arrived in b c 
 Roman Jerusalem
 After the initial years of Roman administration and
 political infighting Rome installed Herod scion of a family from
 Idumea a Jewish kingdom in the desert as King of Judea He reigned
 from to b c during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall
 and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate the foundation of
 which still stand Several palaces were built and a water system
 installed Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple making it one of
 the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire The courtyard
 around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of
 pilgrims and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made
 with great stone blocks One of these walls the Western Wall is today
 a major reminder of Jerusalems greatness under Herod A massive
 fortress was built overlooking the Temple Mount which Herod named
  Antonia in honor of his Roman friend and benefactor Mark Antony 
 For all his accomplishments Herod was nevertheless hated
 by his subjects he taxed he tortured and he ordered the massacre of
 male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah 
 When Jesus was born in about b c Joseph and Mary escaped Herods
 paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new born infant They returned
 to live in the Galilee village of Nazareth making pilgrimages to
 Jerusalem 
 According to biblical accounts Jesus spent his life
 ministering in the Galilee Valley In about a d he and his
 followers went for Passover to Jerusalem which was in unrest at this
 time dissatisfied with Roman domination Jesuss entry into the Temple
 caused a commotion after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the
 temple priests who were under direct Roman rule Jesus was put on
 trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion a Roman form of execution
 for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals 
 In a province rife with rebellion and retaliation the execution in
 Jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the Galilee did not by
 itself have an immediate effect on history 
 After Jesuss crucifixion harsh Roman rule continued until
 a d when the Jews rebelled For four years Jewish zealots fought
 against the might of Rome At the end the Roman general Titus laid
 siege to Jerusalem in a d finally attacking its starved and
 weakened defenders Those who didn’t escape were executed or sold into
 slavery The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed The last of the
 zealots held out for another three years at Masada see page Half
 a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this
 first revolt against Rome a number unequaled in ancient warfare 
 Christian and Islamic Jerusalem
 For years Jerusalem lay in ruins until the Roman
 Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to
 Jupiter In outrage the Jews began a second revolt against Rome led
 by Simon bar Kochba The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated 
 but in the end Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss
 of life The planned new Roman city Aelia Capitolina was built over
 the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem and Jews were barred from residing
 there for all time Jerusalems physical existence as a spiritual city
 seemed finished but its spiritual power for Jews and for the
 struggling new Christian religion remained For the next two centuries
 Aelia Capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history 
 But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth
 century and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again Queen
 Helena a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the
 Great made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in to identify the sites
 associated with Jesuss life She found that the citys most beautiful
 Roman temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite stood on the site of
 the crucifixion The temple was demolished and a vast Classical style
 church was built around Golgotha the hill where Jesuss crucifixion
 was believed to have taken place Throughout Jerusalem other spots
 important to Jesuss life were commemorated with religious structures 
 Pilgrims came from all over the Roman and later Byzantine Empire
 during the following centuries but the prosperity they brought lasted
 only until when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced
 Jerusalem to rubble again In Jerusalem was recaptured by the
 Byzantines 
 Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation 
 Jerusalem was conquered in by the forces of Islam The Temple Mount
 was identified in Islamic tradition as  the farthest spot in Arabic 
 el aksa the site to which the Prophet Muhammad was transported in one
 night from Mecca on a winged horse as described in the th chapter of
 the Koran From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was
 permitted to glimpse paradise The rock on the Temple Mount from which
 he ascended at or close to the site of the ruined Temple was
 commemorated by the construction of the Dome of the Rock in The
 Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalems most striking monument it is
 counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created By about 
 the El Aksa Mosque third holiest place of prayer in Islam after Mecca
 and Medina had been built on the southern side of the Temple Mount 
 Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half
 centuries In under their leaders Godfrey de Bouillon and
 Tancred the Crusaders captured the Holy City for Christendom by
 slaughtering both Muslims and Jews 
 Crusaders Mamelukes and Turks
 The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with
 Godfrey at its head They built many impressive churches during the
 term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem but in they were
 driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin During the
 Sixth Crusade   the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed
 to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation 
 The Christians however could not hold the city After
 they lost Jerusalem a Mongol invasion swept through and in the
 Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control ruling Jerusalem for the next
 years The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and
 invasions Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was
 constructed in the Mameluke era but the past thousand years had taken
 their toll Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had
 enjoyed in earlier times 
 In the early th century the Ottoman Turkish Empire was
 advancing through the Middle East Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in
 remaining under their control for years Suleiman the
 Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this
 day Fountains inns religious schools and barracks were constructed 
 But when Suleiman died his empire including Jerusalem began a long
 period of decline The Holy City remained a backwater until the th
 century when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the
 destination of thousands of travelers each year 
 th Century Aspirations
 At the same time many Jews sought religious freedom and
 fulfillment by moving to Palestine as the Holy Land was traditionally
 called and especially to Jerusalem In the s Theodor Herzl
   worked to organize a movement Zionism to create a Jewish
 state Chaim Weizmann   a scientist born in Russia but later
 a British subject did much to put Herzls hopes into practice 
 Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British
 government that led to the Balfour Declaration of supporting the
 idea of a Jewish  national home in Palestine that also respected the
 rights of existing non Jewish people already living there The problem
 was that British strategists who were fighting the Ottoman Turks in
 had secretly promised the lands to their World War I Arab
 allies 
 In the League of Nations granted the British a mandate
 to administer Palestine Jerusalem flourished during the early years of
 the Mandate Modern neighborhoods hospitals schools and the Hebrew
 University were built in West Jerusalem the new Jewish enclave But
 Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine
 led to increasing strife by Jerusalem was an armed camp In 
 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two
 states one Jewish and one Arab with Jerusalem as an international
 city that belonged to neither But lacking the means to enforce its
 decision the United Nations was powerless to halt the fighting that
 erupted as the British withdrew their troops in 
 Modern Israel
 The State of Israel was declared during this difficult
 time In response member states of the Arab League sent troops to help
 the Palestinian Arabs West Jerusalem separated from the rest of the
 new Jewish nation held out under siege for several months until
 Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the
 coastal areas Jews were evacuated from the Old Citys Jewish Quarter 
 and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem As a
 result of armistice agreements in Jerusalem was divided West
 Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control and East Jerusalem
 including the Old City with its Jewish Muslim Christian and
 Armenian quarters came under Jordanian authority Free access to holy
 sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice
 agreements However with the city partitioned by fortifications and
 barbed wire no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the
 Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem 
 For the next years Jerusalem was two cities Political
 and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of
 terrorism or sniping until the Six Day War in June Within three
 days the city was completely in Israeli hands and in two weeks it was
 physically and administratively reunited Jerusalems mayor Teddy
 Kollek spent the next years orchestrating a vast program of
 development adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting
 neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the
 concerns of Jerusalems many communities 
 Today as always Jerusalem is a city of controversies 
 religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews Palestinians calling for
 independence many residents protesting a wave of high rise development
 that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis But
 the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily
 special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present day
 Jerusalem as it continues to tug at the worlds attention into the new
 millennium 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 A Brief History
 Early Habitation
 The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to
 b c when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake 
 During this period the indigenous people lived in caves hunting the
 mammals that gathered at the shoreline The landscape of the valley
 changed dramatically over the next centuries The glaciers feeding
 the lake melted away and the lake evaporated Fossils tell an obscure
 story of mans slow and sporadic development 
 Around b c native Archaic Indians began to develop a
 lasting hunting and gathering culture By this time the valley was in
 much the same geographic state as it exists in today with one
 exception   the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the
 surface in several areas These springs fed a network of streams
 draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River The areas
 surrounding the springs were desert oases sprawling collections of
 grasses trees and wildlife Many springs lay in areas that would
 eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis 
 For about years the Archaics thrived in a culture that
 included many signs of early civilization Signs of even more
 advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a d when
 the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley Far more progressive than the
 Archaics the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as
 irrigation to assist their harvest This permitted the Anasazi to
 achieve a benchmark of advanced society   the ability to live in
 permanent shelters year round without need to follow wildlife 
 Mysteriously the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a d 
 leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes another
 hunter gatherer tribe 
 Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the
 Anasazi the Paiutes were destined to a semi nomadic lifestyle until
 European settlers arrived changing the nature of existence in the
 valley forever 
 From Mailmen to Mormons
 In the early nineteenth century Americas western
 territories were still largely unexplored It was not until that
 Rafael Rivera a Mexican scout found a spring fed valley and dubbed it
 Las Vegas   a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering
 exactly where  the meadows really lay 
 For fifteen years Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail
 way station In American explorer John C Fremont parked his
 horses at Big Springs and his report to the government resulted in a
 mail route leading past the spot on its way to California This put Las
 Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its
 history 
 In Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising
 reports of Las Vegas by sending missionary settlers to the valley 
 they eventually built a fort not far from todays Downtown Surrounded
 by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert the adobe fort became a
 focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years 
 The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the
 desert trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their
 circumstances and spread the Mormon faith Additional pressures from
 arriving miners pushed the missionaries plight beyond recovery Their
 supplies scarce their harvest meager and their spirit broken they
 abandoned the fort in 
 Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver by
 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors
 headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold One
 opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass Bestowed with plenty
 of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this
 day Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left
 off   at least when it came to ranching and farming Gass took over the
 abandoned Mormon fort and acres hectares surrounding it 
 dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch He expanded the ranch and irrigated the
 land so that it would support crops and cattle His determination had
 other results as well Gass was named a justice of the peace and a
 territorial legislator 
 Despite his ambition Gass success was short lived In the
 late s he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart so
 Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own True to wild West
 stereotypes Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer leaving his
 strong willed wife Helen to assume the duties of the ranch Through
 Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to acres hectares 
 making quite a bit of money in the process 
 What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las
 Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across
 almost all of Western America to this day The railroad was coming and
 when it arrived Las Vegas would never be the same again 
 Of Tracks and Tracts
 At the turn of the th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake
 City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West 
 Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail this was about to
 change quickly When it did the Las Vegas Valley which at the time
 had a non native population of less than would change as well 
 In officials of the San Pedro Los Angeles and Salt
 Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas eager to secure a right of way for
 their Los Angeles Salt Lake connection Las Vegas would serve as a
 major stopover for crew rest and train repair For all this the
 railroad needed land As mapped the track traveled directly through
 Helen Stewarts Las Vegas Ranch Stewart sold percent of her ranch
 to the railroad The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes 
 In early the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake
 City was completed and train tracks bore right down the center of the
 Las Vegas Valley On May the railroad held a land sale   a
 momentous step in Las Vegas history Standing at the depot at Main and
 Fremont streets railroad officials auctioned lots they had
 subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub Land speculators
 and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad
 boomtown and within an afternoon more than percent of the lots
 were sold 
 Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement With
 rail service in place and forty blocks of private property it was
 ready to become a real town Businesses sprang up overnight and wooden
 houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early
 settlers had lived One year after the auction the population of Las
 Vegas had ballooned to residents a portent of things to come for
 the next ninety years 
 Dam Good Luck
 From the beginning Las Vegas was built to serve travelers 
 The railroad needed a way station and Las Vegas was the place Growth
 continued for ten years and by the town had telephones 
 round the clock electricity and a growing population   many of whom
 worked in the railroad repair shop But such heady progress would soon
 come to a halt 
 The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union
 Pacific buying the Los Angeles Salt Lake line Union Pacific then
 consolidated its operations eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility 
 Additionally Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevadas new Clark
 County in a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling 
 These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the
 status of a small desert community that could no longer support its
 residents But the southwests growing need for water combined
 with Las Vegass fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River would give
 Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity 
 Construction on Hoover Dam originally Boulder Dam 
 subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project 
 began in in a canyon miles km southeast of Las Vegas 
 Providing an influx of million to the southwestern economy Hoover
 Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up both
 financially and literally Not only did it create jobs but it also
 created Lake Mead the massive reservoir that today provides water to
 all of southern Nevada 
 More Government Help
 The construction of Hoover Dam did not single handedly save
 Las Vegas however The state legislature helped as well by legalizing
 gambling in and thus solidifying the future of the town though
 legislators and residents could never have known this at the time 
 The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dams 
 dedication set the citys now formidable public relations machine into
 action They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest
 citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted It didn’t take long for the
 city to establish itself as a wild West town with an  anything goes
 attitude Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal
 here available any hour of any day or night Thus originated Las
 Vegass reputation as an adult theme park 
 Additional catalysts for the valleys growth came from
 World War II Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School which became
 Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site in the north and Basic
 Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson arrived in the early s
 as a result of Americas war effort By the population had grown
 to almost with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace 
 But this was not yet the Las Vegas of folklore 
 Mobsters and Rat Packers
 While many gambling halls opened Downtown in the s and
 early s only two were built on the stretch of old Los Angeles
 Highway that ultimately became the Strip The El Rancho Vegas 
 was the first followed by the Last Frontier During this
 period East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin  Bugsy Siegel earned a
 foothold as a local casino operator 
 By Siegel had become one of Las Vegass original
 visionaries planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the LA
 Highway When the Flamingo opened in December it did so with
 Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash But the Mafia bosses who
 financed the operation were displeased with its performance Siegel was
 murdered in the summer of 
 Despite its initial failings Siegels Flamingo survived
 him as did mob infiltration of casinos In fact the Flamingo would
 launch over two decades of strong mob presence in Las Vegas Freely
 flowing  comps complimentary food drink and entertainment were the
 order of the day with mob bosses content to provide an environment of
 pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in 
 While the mob was running the casinos promoters were
 busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert From
 the mid  s to the mid  s Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that
 it was the  Entertainment Capital of the World  Emerging stars no
 longer content with playing small nightclubs came to Las Vegas with
 dreams of making it big Many of them did Frank Sinatra Wayne Newton 
 and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found
 themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were
 written The Rat Pack   originally Frank Sinatra Dean Martin Sammy
 Davis Jr Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop all in town to film Oceans
    landed at the Sands in January for a legendary stay Other
 Hollywood stars came as well simply because Las Vegas was the place to
 be 
 As a result more casinos emerged along the Strip The
 Thunderbird Desert Inn Sahara Sands and Riviera hotels were erected
 during this period luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of
 all night partying exclusive entertainment and cheap accommodations 
 There was no longer any question when you wanted some unbridled adult
 fun Las Vegas was the place to be 
 New Legitimacy
 Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in
 its bid to control Las Vegas   corporate cash Though Las Vegas had
 developed a powerful local economy few major outside investments were
 made in the city due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent
 ties to illegal activities 
 That would change dramatically with the arrival of
 billionaire Howard Hughes A legitimate businessman Hughes was
 nonetheless eccentric and dramatic a style suited to the Las Vegas
 ethos True to the myth the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered
 himself in the Desert Inns penthouse Several weeks later he was
 asked   then ordered   to vacate the room to make room for high
 rollers whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the
 management Thus began Hughes legendary three year  million Las
 Vegas buying spree When it was over Hughes owned six casinos an
 airport and an airline along with numerous plots of land stretching
 from the Strip to the mountains 
 Hughes actions would have beneficial repercussions both
 immediate and lasting Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired
 from Hughes investments established companies such as Hilton Hotels
 bought into the gaming business and their influence helped draw a line
 in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos where
 illegal skimming of profits was rampant That combined with the
 formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board would signal the
 beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city 
 Las Vegas with a Vision
 As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out 
 a new Las Vegas emerged The legitimization of gambling led to its
 increased legalization across the US What was once a sure thing became
 much more competitive Casino operators had to reassess the nature of
 their business 
 The first to really do so was Steve Wynn a Las Vegas
 resident and owner of the Golden Nugget In the mid  s Wynn began
 plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort He bought several
 Strip properties   the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them   and
 demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort   Mirage    which
 became an instant success 
 Wynns demolition of the existing properties started a
 trend that more than any other describes Las Vegas at the end of the
 th century removal of old properties in exchange for the potential
 of new ones This trend has led to many more demolitions including the
 Dunes replaced by Bellagio Aladdin the new Aladdin and Sands
 Venetian hotels 
 Wynns casinos have also set new standards They can no
 longer be just a box filled with gaming tables restaurants and a
 showroom Excalibur the MGM Grand the Luxor and New York New York
 all followed Mirages lead during the s offering themed
 environments and attractions for families 
 As evidence of the  ever faster nature of the city by the
 middle of the s the new approach showed signs of backlash with
 many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience 
 The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post mob era the
 comprehensive resort New resorts offer attractions and amenities
 modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide including
 luxurious spas signature restaurants and exclusive boutiques 
 Additionally a handful of resorts   such as the South Seas
 themed Mandalay Bay the Mirage and the new Four Seasons   are now
 catering exclusively to the luxury travel market The crème de la crème
 of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynns Bellagio The worlds most
 expensive resort at billion the Bellagios amenities include
  star dining Chanel caliber boutiques and a world class collection
 of artistic masterworks Perhaps more important such high end
 accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the
 mythology of the Rat Pack era 
 As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming
 venue the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed Over additional
 hotel rooms have been added in a few short years including resorts in
 Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas Recent business projections for Las Vegas
 predict challenges tourism revenues must increase substantially to
 sustain what is already built while actual figures show visitation as
 steady or declining The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for
 nearly a century may be facing a roadblock 
 Still the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as
 much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else 
 With its new look and new aim the prospects are good despite the
 warnings Inevitably some people will get burned in the process but
 others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes 
 And that more than anything is the one constant that characterizes
 the past present and future of Las Vegas 
 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Dublin and the Dubliners
 As capital of Europes most explosive economy Dublin seems
 to be changing before your very eyes New construction is everywhere 
 the streets buzz traffic is increasingly congested and in the
 frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in Dublin seems intent on changing
 places with everyone else At night the streets are crowded with people
 bent on having a good time Prosperity is in the air the roar of the
  Celtic Tiger can clearly be heard 
 But this is not the whole picture The proverbial
 hospitality and warm welcome are still here This busy modern European
 city sits on a thousand years of history   history is present
 everywhere from elegant Merrion Square to the bullet holes on the
 General Post Office Its also a city of the imagination reinvented
 and reappraised in the literature of its exiles And the old Dublin is
 with us too   the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar
 magic possessed by Ireland and the Irish 
 Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic
 preservation Dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor You
 can view artifacts from the Bronze Age trace the history of the Easter
 Rising or revisit Leopold Blooms odyssey in Ulysses Old buildings
 are being recycled for example the th century Royal Hospital now
 holds the Museum of Modern Art And Dublin a city large in
 expectations is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its
 sights on foot 
 City on the Liffey
 The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center
 of the city to Dublin Bay The river forms a natural line between the
 north and south sections of the city This geography is important in
 understanding Dublin Historically and culturally this north south
 distinction has always been significant and it still is today with a
 dose of good humored rivalry between the two areas   I never go north
 of the Liffey  one man remarked 
 Farther out both north and south are the sweeping curves
 of the Royal and Grand Canals The occasional cry of gulls and
 unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea 
 and the Wicklow mountains which hold Dublin closely to the coast are
 visible from everywhere 
 Dublin is an intimate city physically small but tightly
 packed a perfect place for walking College Green the home of Trinity
 College provides a natural focus just south of the OConnell Street
 bridge OConnell Street the citys grand boulevard leads north to
 Parnell Square To the south and east is St Stephens Green and
 Georgian Dublin where the national museums are located Along the
 Liffey to the west is Temple Bar center of nightlife and home to many
 of Dublins cutting edge artists and artistic endeavors Up the hill
 from Temple Bar are Dublin Castle and Christ Church Cathedral 
 It wont rain on you in Dublin all the time The climate
 here can best be described as  changeable and yet the sudden shifts
 from light to dark sunshine to shower are part of the citys magic 
 Buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light Dublin
 under a lowering sky is a different place from Dublin in sunshine 
 Enjoying Dublin
 Literature has always flourished in Dublin the only city
 to have produced three Nobel Prize winners for literature   Yeats 
 Shaw and Beckett Joyce the high priest of literary Modernism 
 imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses youll see
 references to it all over However sometimes it seems that the city
 produced artists of this stature by accident even against its will 
 Beckett and Joyce among others had to leave their homeland to
 understand it    and to be understood 
 Dublin theater is legendary and no visitor should miss
 seeing a performance at the Abbey Theatre or Gate Theatre The citys
 impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U and Bob
 Geldof is well known   theres even a self guided tour of their haunts 
 Traditional Irish music is also alive and well especially in the pubs 
 and there has been a revival of storytelling poetry reading and
 traditional dancing And in this city where literature and theater
 have historically dominated the scene visual arts are finally coming
 into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries
 that display the work of modern Irish artists 
 The constantly crowded and busy Grafton street is the most
 visible center for shopping but there are shops all over that carry an
 international array of goods as well as the Irish crafts and souvenirs
 you expect And while multinational chains have made inroads they seem
 less blatant here than elsewhere Many shops and also hotels and guest
 houses have been owned and managed by the same families for years and
 theirs is the welcome of traditional Dublin hospitality 
 Dublins food has undergone a metamorphosis There was a
 time when you might have apologized for it but no longer Dublin has
 international restaurants galore and the New Irish Cuisine is built
 upon fresh products of Irelands seas rivers and farms Coffee has
 replaced the ubiquitous tea   Dublin is now almost as much a coffee
 city as Vienna or Seattle 
 City and Countryside
 In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising
 that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation Phoenix
 Park in the northwest is the largest open space but squares like St 
 Stephens Green are the garden oases of the city 
 On the coast Sandymount Dollymount and Killiney strands
 are the places to go The beautiful Wicklow Mountains and the Wicklow
 Mountains National Park provide a more rugged countryside and the area
 has breathtaking houses and gardens such as Castletown Mount Usher 
 and Powerscourt To the north and west are the ancient sites of
 Ireland Malahide Castle the evocative hill of Tara and the long
 barrows of Knowth and Newgrange 
 The DART Dublin Area Rapid Transit runs north and south
 along the coast Its an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying
 sights and villages There are many guided bus tours to sights outside
 the city and some are accessible by city bus 
 Young at Heart 
 Dublin is a young city Almost half of Irelands population
 is under twenty five and with its universities and professional
 schools Dublin also has a large student population The universities
 attract students from all over the world and this influx helps to make
 Dublin a busy buzzing international city However young and old 
 stranger and Dubliner rub shoulders quite happily Religion and respect
 for parents has not yet gone out of fashion And young graduates are
 not leaving now   multinational corporations and European Union
 investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home 
 Unemployment is at an all time low The Irish are actually beginning to
 come home 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 Hong Kong and
 Its People
 Exciting mysterious glamorous   these words have described
 Hong Kong for at least a century With its vibrant atmosphere and
 night and day activity it is an intoxicating place Hong Kong is
 crowded   it has one of the worlds greatest population densities But
 it is also efficient with one of the best transportation systems
 anywhere and for such a crowded place quiet   you don’t hear voices
 raised in anger motorists sitting on their horns or loud boomboxes 
 Shopping never ends   theres always another inviting spot just down
 the street Youll find Hong Kong easy to get around the people
 helpful English spoken everywhere and food that lives up to its
 reputation 
 On July the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong
 reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of
 the Peoples Republic of China Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist
 enclave with its laws and rights intact and China has promised that
 Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least years 
 Beijings announced policy of maintaining Hong Kongs prosperity and
 stability makes sense Hong Kong has long been Chinas handiest window
 on the West and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know how and
 managerial expertise Around the time of the transition there was much
 speculation about how things would change But in fact once news of
 the handover vanished from the front pages the people of Hong Kong
 returned to their usual topics of conversation the economy and the
 price of housing 
 The impression of the visitor today will be that very little
 has changed Establishments are no longer called  Royal  Queen
 Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage and the Union Jack has been
 replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its
 bauhinia flower But in fact there have been changes many of them due
 to economic progress new construction and other factors that
 influence cities all over the world 
 Others are more subtle British social customs are still
 evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long
 lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour The British population
 has decreased today there are as many American and Australian ex pats
 as there are British 
 With a population of nearly eight million and a total area
 of just over square km square miles housing is one of Hong
 Kongs perennial nightmares To alleviate the problem the government
 has become the citys major landlord with the construction of massive
 apartment blocks that though they have every modern facility average
 only square m square ft in size Whole cities have been created
 in the New Territories although the unimaginative architecture of
 these towns has been criticized 
 Of Hong Kongs population percent are Chinese The
 majority are Cantonese born in Hong Kong or from South China but
 there are immigrants from all over China The Chinese people have been
 described as hardworking and pragmatic attitudes that have contributed
 to Hong Kongs success There are many stories of refugees who arrived
 with nothing in their pockets set up a small sidewalk stall worked
 diligently until they had their own store and then expanded it into a
 modest chain 
 Old customs are still followed Fate and luck are taken very
 seriously and astrologers and fortune tellers do a steady business 
 Before a skyscraper can be built a feng shui see page 
 investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building
 will promote health harmony and prosperity Youll also notice that
 gambling is a passion whether it be cards mah jong the lottery or
 the horses Hong Kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive
 off track betting system and on weekends the ferries to Macau are
 crowded with people on their way to the casinos 
 Sightseeing in Hong Kong starts at sea level with the
 enthralling water traffic   a mix of freighters ferries tugs junks 
 and yachts Views of the city and the harbor are panoramic From
 Victoria Peak Hong Kongs highest point or from skyscrapers and
 hotels they are especially exciting at night when the lights are
 on 
 The business and financial center and the signature soaring
 architecture are on Hong Kong Island Across Victoria Harbor connected
 by ferry and the MTR rail line is the Kowloon peninsula with its
 hotels nightlife and almost non stop shopping Beyond in the New
 Territories are a mixture of high rise suburban towns ancient sites
 and walled villages country parks and farms with ducks and fish
 ponds Hong Kongs other less developed islands Lantau Lamma and
 Cheung Chau provide getaways You can also take a ferry to Macau to
 find an entirely different kind of city a unique blend of Chinese and
 Iberian culture 
 Its anyones guess what may happen in the future but for
 now Hong Kong bristles with energy and ambition and for the visitor 
 this beautiful city with its contrasts and variety is an exhilarating
 experience 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 What to Do
 Shopping
 Inflation has taken its toll in Hong Kong While its no
 longer the bargain shopping destination it once was there are still
 some good buys to be had Since Hong Kong is a duty free port and
 charges no sales tax goods are cheaper here than in the country where
 they were made On photographic equipment electronic goods and
 watches you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home country 
 Specialty goods and souvenirs often handmade come from Hong Kong and
 elsewhere in China Custom made garments by skillful Hong Kong tailors
 are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable
 garments Note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to Hong
 Kongs duty free regime and are subject to tax 
 Youll find that prices are about the same in Hong Kong
 Central and Kowloon and somewhat cheaper in Causeway Bay which caters
 to local shopping Large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to
 be more expensive than smaller  family shops tucked away in the side
 streets 
 Stores do not open until am or later but shopping goes on
 into the evening up to pm Most shops are open seven days a week 
 Shops in Central are an exception they generally close at pm and are
 not open on Sunday The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a
 halt is the Chinese New Year in January or February 
 Buyer Beware Be aware that name brands including
 electronics are sometimes fakes glass may be sold as jade and that
 antique you bought may have been made last night Always ask for a
 receipt that records information about the item and if you buy an
 antique be sure to get a certificate of authentication Needless to
 say avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take
 you to wondrous bargains 
 The large department stores have fixed prices but elsewhere
 you should ask whether there is a discount especially if you buy
 several items in one shop Compare prices before you buy any
 significant item Always ask to see the manufacturers guarantee when
 purchasing watches cameras and audio visual and electronic
 equipment 
 Note that when haggling the merchant assumes you are
 prepared to pay cash If after concluding a deal you try to pay with
 a credit card he may then boost the price in order to cover the card
 charges 
 It is advisable to shop at outlets that are members of the
 Hong Kong Tourist Association HKTA identified by a red junk logo 
 Membership imposes an obligation to maintain standards of both quality
 and service and provides dissatisfied customers with an officially
 recognized channel for redressing complaints the number to call is
 Tel Pick up a copy of HKTAs  The Official Dining 
 Entertainment Shopping Directory in which all member stores are
 listed 
 Shipping Many stores will pack and ship purchases Ask if
 automatic free insurance is provided If the goods are very valuable or
 fragile it is a good idea to buy an all risk insurance for the
 shipment Packages sent to the US or to Europe generally take six to
 eight weeks by surface mail and one week by airmail

 Where to Go
 T he crowded Kowloon peninsula and the booming New
 Territories on the mainland call for some serious sightseeing but we
 begin across Victoria Harbor on Hong Kong Island where the city was
 first founded and which remains the center of government business and
 commerce 
 Hong Kong Central
 No matter how many tunnels and transit systems speed
 cross harbor traffic nothing matches the ride on the Star Ferry from
 Kowloon to the Central District across Victoria Harbor As the
 double decker boats get ready to leave the pier bells ring the
 gangplank is raised deckhands in blue sailor suits man the hawsers 
 and a couple of hundred commuters begin a seven minute sightseeing
 tour The big green and white boat weaves its way through an
 ever changing obstacle course of both large and small craft and the
 soaring skyline of Hong Kong Island draws nearer 
 As you get off the  story Jardine House with
 porthole shaped windows catches the eye There are restaurants and a
 Starbucks in the basement and you can access the raised pedestrian
 crosswalk from the escalators on the ground floor Next to the Jardine
 building is Exchange Square a complex with a large shopping mall just
 behind it is the General Post Office with a philatelic center on the
 ground floor 
 Farther west is the ferry terminal for the outlying islands 
 On Connaught Road Central youll find one of Hong Kongs curiosities 
 the  m   ft  long Mid Levels outdoor escalator It ferries
 commuters from the Mid Levels apartment complexes downhill from to
 am and uphill from am to midnight Nearby is Central Market the
 wholesale food market of Hong Kong and the Hang Seng building private
 offices 
 Just east of the Star Ferry terminal youll come to City
 Hall No longer a center of government it now functions as a cultural
 center Go through the underground walkway to Statue Square on the
 east side of the square is the Legislative Council Building one of the
 few colonial buildings left in Hong Kong So great is the pressure on
 the available land that most of Hong Kongs colonial architectural
 heritage has been demolished and replaced by new skyscrapers Despite
 protests by preservationists there was little alternative 
 Nearby is Chater Garden and a number of notable
 architectural landmarks Most famous is the striking  story I M Pei
 Bank of China Tower not beloved by the people of Hong Kong   its
 triangular prisms and sharp angles violate the principles of feng shui
 see box page and its radio masts stick up like an insects
 antennae The rival Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank is by architect Norman
 Foster built on a  coathanger frame  its floors hang rather than
 ascend From inside the vast atrium you can view the whole structure as
 well as the mechanical workings of the building Two bronze lions 
 carrying out feng shui principles guard its doors 
 You can catch one of Hong Kongs historic trams along Des
 Voeux Road and ride from Central to Causeway Bay see box page In
 the narrow double decker trams ran along the waterfront but
 land reclamation has placed them far inland 
 From the Bank of China Tower make a short detour up Garden
 Road and turn into Battery Path to reach the landmark St Johns
 Cathe­dral Built   this usually deserted Anglican foundation
 is Hong Kongs oldest church During World War II the church was
 turned into a club for Japanese officers it was restored after the
 war Note the stained glass windows in the Quiet Chapel designed by
 Joseph Edward Nuttgens in the late s Behind the church is the 
 French Mission Building now used as the Court of Final Appeal 
 Across from the I M Pei tower a winding path leads up to
 Hong Kong Park The parks hectares acres of landscaped
 gardens and lakes contains a large greenhouse that holds many species
 of plants and an aviary of exotic birds In the park is the Flagstaff
 House Museum of Tea Ware see page Its in Hong Kongs oldest
 colonial building with exhibits describing the history of tea from the
 Warring States period   b c to the present 
 If you leave the park and walk up Cotton Tree Drive you
 will find the Peak Tram terminal 
 To the Summit
 For more than a century the most exhilarating way up
 Victoria Peak has been by funicular The Peak Tram starts its scenic
 climb just across the street and around the corner from the American
 Consulate in Garden Road and makes its way sometimes at a startlingly
 steep incline to the summit at m ft The right of way
 travels past fancy apartment blocks bamboo stands and jungle flowers 
 Passengers crane their necks for dizzying glimpses of the harbor The
 Peak is still the most fashionable place to live in Hong Kong but real
 estate prices here are astronomical rents run around HK a
 month 
 The Peak Tram originally steam powered was built to speed
 the wealthy taipans to their mountainside retreats Before the tram was
 built sedan chairs and rickshaws were the only way to get here Since
 the trams inauguration in it has stopped only for typhoons and
 World War II 
 The modern  passenger cars make the journey in around
 eight minutes However on sunny Saturdays and Sundays you may have to
 brave a crowd lining up at the lower terminal During the spring and
 autumn festivals when people traditionally seek out the hilltops the
 throngs are so large you would be better advised to try another
 time 
 At the upper terminus there is a four level shopping
 center the Peak Galleria and the Peak Tower which resembles an
 airport control tower and has shops entertainment and
 restaurants 
 You can walk around the peak for impressive views of Hong
 Kong the coastline and the islands in minutes on Lugard and
 Harlech roads The view is especially effective at night There are
 also souvenir stands benches for a rest and perhaps Hong Kongs last
 surviving rickshaws   however these are not for rides but are a
 tourist photo opportunity If you’re up to a climb take the Mount
 Austin road to the Victoria Peak Gardens These gardens used to belong
 to the governors mountain lodge but the building was demolished by
 the Japanese during the occupation of Hong Kong 
 From the lower terminal of the Peak Tram its only a short
 walk to the former governors residence Government House now a
 museum Across from the mansion the Zoological and Botanical Gardens
 gardens open daily am  pm zoo am  pm admission free provide a
 welcome oasis amid the big city pressures In the very early morning

 wonderful chattering jungle birds

 Temple the islands oldest house of worship though the date of its
 founding is subject to dispute Visitors entering the temple are
 confronted by a dense pall of smoke from all the burning joss sticks
 and the incense coils hanging from the ceiling these will burn for as
 long as a month The gold plated sedan chairs on the left hand side of
 the temple were once used for transporting the statues of the temples
 gods in religious processions The statues in the main shrine represent
 Man the god of literature and Mo the god of war a curious
 juxtaposition The temple is always crowded with worshipers 
 Just past the temple is the aptly named Ladder Street Go

 Lane where youll find the Museum of Medical Sciences open

 make this area vibrant and lively 
 On the nautical side is the Causeway Bay typhoon shelter 
 where expensive yachts are anchored almost gunwale to gunwale and the
 Hong Kong Yacht Club has its headquarters Across Gloucester Road 
 opposite the World Trade Centre is the Noonday Gun which under
 British rule was sounded on the stroke of midday Silent for a time 
 the tradition has been revived and is a tourist attraction Its not
 clear how the custom started One story has it that traders Jardine 
 Matheson Co fired a private salute for a visiting tycoon an act
 that incensed the colonial authorities who felt that they had the sole
 right to issue such a  gun welcome As a result the merchants were
 forced to limit their salvoes to one a day   and from then on they
 signaled the noon hour daily for all to hear The gun was made famous
 by Noel Cowards satirical song  Mad Dogs and Englishmen 
 Farther east is Hong Kongs largest park Victoria Park

 over all the New Territories to the north can be seen from Tai Mo Shan 
 Hong Kongs highest peak at m ft The highway continues
 parallel to the coast One third of all Hong Kongs beaches are to be
 found in a single  km  mile stretch of this regions shoreline 
 Place names are often based on the distance to the nearest mile post 
 as measured from the tip of the Kowloon peninsula Thus you will find
      mile Beach at Castle Peak Bay 
 The main road continues clockwise around the New
 Territories As you approach the border you can glimpse the
 skyscrapers of Shenzhen The lookout point at Lok Ma Chau was once
 known as Hong Kongs  window on China   in the years of Chinas
 isolation from the West tourists would come to the lookout point here
 and rent binoculars in order to get a glimpse of the great mystery
 beyond 
 Set amid Tseun Wans residential towers is the th century
 walled village of Sam Tung Uk now preserved as a museum and a short
 walk from the MTR station Not far away at milepost near the large
 new town of Tuen Mun is a Taoist retreat known as Ching Chung Koon 
 This  Temple of Green Pines is a spacious complex containing temples
 and pavilions statues and gardens It is known for its collection of
 bonsai and houses a jade seal more than years old Among the
 ponds is one inhabited by turtles Visitors toss in coins in the hope
 of bouncing one off a turtles head a sure way of achieving good
 fortune 
 An even more interesting image out of Chinese history is
 the walled village of Kat Hing Wai in the village of Kam Tin just
 outside the market town of Yuen Long This is the most easily
 accessible of the New Territories walled villages It is built in a
 square and the only way in is through the gate in the brick defensive
 wall Kat Hing Wai was built four or five centuries ago by the Hakka
 Tang clan one of the Five Great Clans that migrated here from North
 China see page Many of the old houses in the village have been
 replaced by modern structures 
 The Tang clans earliest walled village was Lo Wai which
 also has its defensive wall intact and is entered by a narrow gate 
 Adjacent to the village is the restored Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall 
 Few traditional ancestral halls remain in China since the
 anti historical destruction during the Cultural Revolution so these
 New Territories ancestral halls are rare survivors Another such hall 
 belonging to the Liu Clan is Liu Man Shek Tong in the village of
 Sheung Shui 
 One of the most interesting sites in the New Territories is
 Tai Fu Tai another rare survivor this one a mansion that belonged to
 a Confucian high official The house was built in by a member of
 the Man clan who achieved the rank of tai fu mandarin by doing well
 in the Imperial Exam­inations The preservation of this wonderful home
 is ongoing a projected restoration of the original garden is still in
 progress The traditional Qing Dyna­sty style of the mansion is
 enlivened by a few West­ern touches a Baroque style ceiling and
 stained glass above the doorways showing the builders up to date
 attitude at the time of construction 
 The highway and the railway stay close together from
 Fanling site of the best golf courses in the area Tai Po just south
 of Fanling is known for its market Tai Po Market which buzzes with
 activity daily from am to pm Just up a lane from the market is the
 Man Mo Temple with long burning incense coils hanging from its
 ceiling a popular spot dedicated to the Taoist gods of war and
 literature 
 The railway line then curves gracefully around Tolo Harbor 
 an idyllic body of water well protected from the open sea You can take
 a ferryboat through the harbor past the ingenious Plover Cove
 reservoir a water catchment area appropriated by damming and draining
 a broad inlet from the sea The boats go on to the friendly fishermens
 island of Tap Mun in Mirs Bay with stops in remote hamlets of the Sai
 Kung Peninsula The Sai Kung area is the location of two official parks
 and nature preserves while on the south side of the peninsula are some
 of the territorys best beaches 
 From the next railway station the modern campus of the
 Chinese University of Hong Kong is visible Teaching here is conducted
 in both Chinese and English The Art Gallery in the Institute of
 Chinese Studies Building is worth a visit for its painting and
 calligraphy collections 
 Sha Tin is the site of the Monastery of Buddhas 
 which looks down on a burgeoning town There are hundreds of stone
 steps in the hillside to walk up before you reach Man Fat Temple with
 its regiments of small gilt statues of Buddha lining the walls Some
 indefatigable climbers will want to go up to the top of the nine story
 pink pagoda for a panoramic view There is a total of Buddha
 statues here plus the remains of the monasterys founder embalmed in
 gold leaf Also here is the Hongkong Heritage Museum call Tel 
 for open hours The museum has an art collection and displays of
 toys and other artifacts 
 Down to earth the Sha Tin Racecourse can accommodate over
 spectators and is equipped with every imaginable luxury 
 including a giant video screen facing the stands and for the horses 
 air conditioned stables Opposite the Sha Tin railway station New Town
 Plaza features shops cinemas and even a computer controlled musical
 fountain 
 Two natural rock formations are always pointed out on
 excursions Sha Tin Rock better known as Amah Rock is actually a pile
 of several rocks that resemble a woman with a baby in a sling on her
 back Legend has it that a local woman climbed the hill every day to
 watch for her husband returning from across the sea one day the wife
 and her child were turned to stone as a permanent symbol of her
 enduring faith Closer to town is Lion Rock shaped like a lion lying
 in wait It really looks the part the tourists know its name even
 before the guide can translate it 
 The Islands
 Excursion companies sell a variety of orientation cruises
 of Hong Kong harbor that include a look at some of its outlying
 islands These pleasant but expensive outings can lay the foundation
 for your own explorations aboard the cheap but usually comfortable
 ferries used by the islanders themselves From the ferry terminals on
 Hong Kong Island you can escape to islands without cars or cares where
 the local people smile  hello and if you’re lucky point you to a
 secret beach for the ultimate in quality leisure time For ferry

 Lantau Island
 The mountainous island of Lantau is the biggest in the
 colony and covers nearly twice the area of Hong Kong Island Chek Lap
 Kok airport sits on reclaimed land just off Lantau plans to build a
 bridge may change Lantau but at present it is sparsely populated and
 makes a perfect getaway 
 At m ft Lantau Peak is high enough to attract
 the occasional rain cloud   refreshingly cool breezes blow on most hot
 summer days More than half the island is parkland and there is a
  km  mile circular hiking trail see page Ferries depart
 from Central every two hours between am and pm to Silvermine
 Bay Mui Wo where a bus terminal has buses to all parts of the
 island There are also ferries to Discovery Bay 
 A short bus ride away is Cheung Sha Beach km miles 
 long and popular for its white sand and excellent facilities 
 The most famous site on the island is the worlds tallest
 seated bronze statue of Buddha at m ft the Tiantan Buddha
 see page The statue and a small museum are on a peak up 
 steps above Po Lin Monastery The monastery is strictly vegetarian 
 and visitors are warned not to bring any meat with them You can have a
 delicious vegetarian lunch here 
 From the monastery hikers enjoy the two hour cross country
 trek down to Silvermine Bay but the authorities have warned walkers to
 be on the lookout for snakes which can be plentiful in the Lantau
 hinterland especially in summer The hillsides that surround the
 monastery are the site of Hong Kongs only tea plantation Visitors are
 welcome to visit the  hectare  acre establishment and may sample
 the end product Lantau tea 
 The islands largest community is Tai O The people of this
 picturesque village make their living by fishing duck breeding and
 food processing Many of the inhabitants live   by choice not
 necessarily through economic hardship   on the water aboard houseboats
 or in houses on stilts in the main creek 
 A Trappist monastery situated on a hillside overlooking
 the east coast of Lantau is also open to visitors To get here follow
 the path from the southwest end of Discovery Bay the walk takes about
 minutes 
 Cheung Chau
 Some km miles west of Hong Kong lies this small 
 crowded island only one square mile in size More than people
 live here mostly by fishing but there are also ex pats attracted by
 its laid back Mediterranean ambience The island has a checkered past
 of smuggling and pira cy That era is gone now but other elements of
 the islands old life are preserved The people still carve jade and
 build seaworthy junks all by hand Fish heads discreetly wrapped in
 paper are still hung out to dry in the sun 
 Cheung Chau becomes the center of Hong Kong life once a
 year usually in May during the Bun Festival a folklore extravaganza
 see page The rest of the year life goes on at its accustomed
 pace rickety machines chugging in two man factories children in
 school uniforms being ferried home to houseboats and the old fishermen
 stirring shrimp paste 
 By way of formal tourist attractions Pak Tai Temple built
 in has some fine carvings and a great iron sword said to be 
 years old But the most interesting thing to do here is to explore the
 two villages on the island Cheung Chau and San Wai They are an easy
 walk apart by the harbor road or a longer  minute hike on the scenic
 Peak Road The Praya the promenade in front of the ferry pier is a
 good place to observe the many junks and fishing boats in the harbor 
 There are also several open air restaurants where you can enjoy fresh
 seafood 
 Lamma Island
 Only minutes by ferry from Central Lamma Island is
 perfect for swimming hiking picnicking birdwatching or just sitting
 back to watch the bananas grow Hong Kongs third largest island has a
 population of only about it is still largely undeveloped and
 life on Lamma if not totally primitive is close to the essentials 
 Archaeologists indicate that Lamma has probably been inhabited for some
 years and the island is known as  Hong Kongs Stone Age Island 
 
 The principal settlements are Yung Shue Wan on Lammas
 northwest and Sok Kwu Wan on the east coast Both villages offer good
 waterfront restaurants with homestyle Chinese food principally seafood
 fresh from the tank The ports are within hiking distance of several
 beautiful beaches and within a one hour hike of each other on a marked
 trail You can build an appetite for dinner by making your way from the
 beach to the restaurant Yung Shue Wan is still a very British
 residential enclave with many nice pubs 
 An Excursion to Macau
 Macau the final bastion of Portugals great th century
 empire is much more than just a quirk of history Here where East and
 West first met life combines the spirit of Asia with something of the
 sunny atmosphere of the Mediterranean 
 Macaus historic center with its colonial architecture 
 has a distinctly Medit­er­ranean flavor Col­­o­n­na­­ded public
 buildings iron balconies winding streets flagstoned squares and the
 many churches all speak of the Portuguese inheritance as well as the
 Chinese a fusion of East and West that has produced the unique
 Macanese culture 
 The story of the Western discovery of Macau begins in 
 when Portuguese explorer Jorge Alvares reached the south coast of
 China Traders followed in his wake setting up bases in several parts
 of the Pearl River estuary Finally in they were all
 consolidated in Macau It was the only European gateway to China and
 through Macau flowed Western technology and religion In Pope
 Gregory XIII created the Macau diocese covering all of China and
 Japan 
 No less impressive were the secular challenges China and
 Japan were not on speaking terms so trade between them had to be
 channeled through a neutral middleman Lucky Macau fit the
 specifications exactly Portugals resulting near monopoly of East West
 trade understandably awakened the competitive instincts of other
 European powers The Dutch sent an invasion flotilla to Macau in 
 but the defenders triumphed However the end of the golden age was
 drawing near China began to relax trade restrictions and with the
 rise of Hong Kong Macau became an isolated Portuguese outpost 
 A haven for persecuted Japanese Christians in the th
 century Portugals neutrality during World War II assured the
 territory a flood of refugees They were joined by a swarm of spies of
 all conceivable nationalities and Macau won a name for international
 intrigue 
 Portugals very precarious foothold on the Asian coast
 ended in with a formal handover to China Macau now the Chinese
 Special Economic Zone of Zhuhai is becoming something like a boomtown
 as an exporter of toys furniture and electronics New construction in
 the past years has changed the citys skyline with new glittering
 hotels and highrise apartment blocks the city is beginning to look a
 little more like Hong Kong 
 Macaus population is estimated at around an
 appallingly high figure for such a small area recent land reclamation
 has eased the situation to some extent If a trace of tropical lethargy
 still adds to the charm in this city of sidewalk cafés palm trees and
 pedicabs any torpor definitely ends once inside the doors of Macaus
 casinos scene of some of the liveliest gambling west of Las Vegas 
 Gambling provides almost percent of the governments tax revenues 
 and is a major source of employment Its spin off industries 
 prostitution and pawn shops also thrive

 to Portugals King John IV in the th century For all its historic
 grandeur the loyal Senate now is the equivalent of a city council its
 statesmanship dedicated to water supplies sewage lines and the
 establishment of playgrounds 
 Macaus most memorable monument is the Baroque façade of
 the ruins of S o Paulo the only remains of a beautiful th century
 Jesuit church On top of a hill in the center of the city its

 Shenzhen is a premier shopping center and much cheaper
 than Hong Kong It is known for its inexpensive but well made 
 knock off designer goods You can use your Hong Kong dollars here so
 theres no need to change currency Some places take credit cards but
 cash is better for bargaining Just across the border is the huge Lo Wu
 City shopping mall to which you can walk other shopping malls are
 nearby 
 Shenzhens main tourist attractions are its enormous theme
 parks One of them   Splendid China   purports to show  all of China in
 one day  It contains elaborate replicas of Chinas chief monuments in
 impressive detail including a scaled down version of the Great Wall 
 The China Folk Culture Villages represent Chinas ethnic variety 
 they feature craftspeople in traditional costumes along with folksong

Good news As you indicated would happen Kalen Pieper called me mid week We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delaineys leadership She explored my views about doing business with government Shortly thereafter Daves office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 

Kay Chapman explained that Daves schedule would keep him out of pocket until August In order to move forward Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man I do look forward to meeting Dave himself 

Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine tune my thinking   preparation for Thursdays meeting with Janet 

Thank you for your all of your help I am pleased and appreciative that things are moving forward at a good clip

Dear Ken 

Im not sure quite were to turn but was hoping you could assist me I would like to keep this confidential especially regarding the New York Office As my request has nothing to do with the people in this office or the group they are wonderful

Ive been with Enron since and I relocated up to Connecticut to work with the New Power Company when I thought that the Enron employees would stay Enron employees Afterwards of course we all were changed to NewPower employees After a couple of months I made the move back to Enron and went to the New York office and work with the Enron Metals group here at rd street It was never my intention to leave Enron 

Since the bombing I feel very displaced and my husband and I would really like to come back to Houston and was wondering if you could help me I was on the trading floor working with Dave Delaineys group when he was in ENA and also was the Exec Secretary Coordinator with the MWB group in George Warsoffs group 

I would appreciate it very much if you were able to assist guide me

Dear Mr Lay 

Im writing this note to you as a show of support to you during your dire
times The reason that I share this with you is my respect for you as a
CEO a business leader and a person My wife is one of your employees who
routinely shares stories about you that are nothing less than inspiring I
know that during difficult times sometimes words emerge that can help
people through difficult times I believe that you are sincere man and
know that you must be broken hearted but I hope that this article can help
you lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly My wife Shelly
Pierce has worked for Enron for the past two years and like many of your
employees has lost a great deal of her life savings Of course I accept
most of the blame for this for reasons related to this article I lost my
investment discipline and held out the false hope that Enron could not
falter After reading the article to her while I was out of town I
believe that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face the
challenges that lay before you 

Mr Lay I appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and our
family and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successes 

 
From the USA Today Tuesday November page A 

 In recession face brutal facts thrive 


By Jim Collins

A man in his early s recently asked me  So whats a recession like  
Its an entirely alien concept to him hed grown up during the greatest
economic boom in modern memory His question drove home the fact that we
havent faced a severe protracted economic setback for nearly decades 
leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times 

With this recession   long in coming perhaps long to stay   now
officially upon us it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key
lesson about how great companies and great people deal with difficult
times differently from how they deal with merely good ones That lesson is
the  Stockdale Paradox   a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge
from tough times not just intact but stronger 

Adm Jim Stockdale was the highest ranking U S military officer in the
Hanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War Tortured many times during his
 year imprisonment Stockdale lived without any prisoners rights no set
release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his
family 

He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war
against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda 
At one point he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor 
deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an
example of a  well treated prisoner   He exchanged secret intelligence
information with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery
would mean more torture and perhaps death After his release Stockdale
became the first three star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both
aviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor 

You can understand then my anticipation at the prospect of spending
part of an afternoon with Stockdale who happened to be at the Hoover
Institute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford In
preparation I read In Love and War the book he and his wife wrote to
chronicle their experiences those years 

As I read the book I found myself getting depressed It just seemed
so bleak   the uncertainty of his fate the brutality of his captors And
then it dawned on me Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable office 
looking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoon 
Im getting depressed reading this and I know that he gets out reunites
with his family and becomes a national hero If it feels depressing for
me how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not
know the end of the story 

 I never lost faith in the end of the story   Stockdale said when I
asked him  I never doubted not only that I would get out but also that I
would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of
my life that in retrospect I would not trade  

I didn’t say anything for many minutes and we continued the slow walk
toward the faculty club Stockdale limping and arc swinging his leg still 
stiff from repeated torture Finally I asked  Who didn’t make it out  

 Oh that’s easy   he said  The optimists  

 The optimists  I don’t understand   I said completely confused 

 The optimists Oh they were the ones who said Were going to be
out by Christmas And Christmas would come and Christmas would go Then
theyd say Were going to be out by Easter And Easter would come and
Easter would go And then Thanksgiving and then it would be Christmas
again And they died of a broken heart  

After another long pause he turned to me and said  This is a very
important lesson You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in
the end   which you can never afford to lose   with the need for discipline
to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they
might be  

My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me but I
never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began
to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to 
become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties 
weakened and dispirited We found that companies that became great
embraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradox 

Fannie Mae for example found itself in the recession losing M
every business day with B in loans under water Many analysts thought
Fannie Mae which was getting on its mortgage portfolio but paying 
on the debt it issued was doomed 

But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not
merely survive but also to prevail as a great company Yes they
confronted the brutal fact that the interest rate problem was not going to
magically disappear certainly not by Christmas But they used this grim
fact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based on
asking three central questions of greatness 


 What can we potentially do better than any other company in the
 world 
 

 What can best drive our economic engine 
 

 What best ignites the passions of our people 
 

 Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring 
Fannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions 
Eventually it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the
general stock market 

When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote 
Fannie Mae off Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company 
 Of course we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things but we never
entertained the possibility that we would fail We were going to use the
calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company  

The sad truth is that most executive teams wont respond that way to
these dark days of uncertainty Instead of using this recession as an
opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture
of discipline the will simply restructure lay off a bunch of people and
liquidate their cultural equity Mediocre leaders will hold out false 
hopes for a quick fix only to watch those hopes be swept away by events 
Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart 

It need not be this way Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox  
those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail
in the end but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal
facts of reality   will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce 
greatness 

 Used correctly this recession can be a defining time in your firms
history that in retrospect you would not trade Used wrongly this
recession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to
become great The choice is yours

Dear guys

Having been out of the office for a couple of days i’ve found myself the 
victim of theft again This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from 
its  hiding place  under my telephone I always lock my drawers and keep 
the key in the same place but on arriving in the office today I found the 
drawers unlocked and the key missing Although theres nothing sensitive on 
or around my desk i’m concerned about the security implications of someone 
sniffing around the office in this manner I also found the papers on my 
desk extensively reshuffled last week 

Last year in our old office I had my only two real options books stolen 
from among the many and varied books on my desk That couldnt have been a 
random theft and I fear this isn’t either I cant understand whod be so 
interested in a Research guys belongings 

Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious 
activity around my desk 

Cheers Steve

 I agree with you that its a lesson people need to learn
over and over again I cant tell you how many politicians
I met over the past year who really don’t like markets and
certainly don’t understand how or why they work These
arent just the minor leaguers in Sacramento but the big
league players in Washington 

 I also agree that the academic community can play  an important
role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of
deregulation process   Id like to think that is in large
part what I have been trying to do

Subject Ken Lays email to Sen 






Greetings All 

First I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email Schedule is
very tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this
morning with some back up info that i’ve included below 

Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening for
delivery to Sen Brulte Its of course confidential Few points 

I don’t have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would
be appreciated 
As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on
Wednesday i’m assuming that the plan is still to  wallpaper  Sacramento with
our proposed legislation 
This email does not contain the legislation Mike sent the  final  versions
of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I
believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today 
Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver 
to
his office today the proposed legislation Again based on our call on
Wednesday i’m assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed
legislation to the rest of the world at the same time 
When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would
determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same
time that we deliver the Senator Brulte i’m assuming that you folks will
handle that end of things Please let us know at your convenience to whom
youve decided to circulate 
This email does however include a  summary  of our proposed legislation 
But i’m not certain that the summary included in this email is the
appropriate language to distribute  to the world   or if well need instead
to tailor some new language I think we all agreed that we need a  one
pager  to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the
package effectively 
We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our
proposals We didn’t finalize that plan Perhaps the Sacramento team could
propose a plan to do that Perhaps we could start with our friends in the
Direct Access coalition 
We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the 
PR
machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our
 legislative package message Were in a meeting with folks today where we
can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted
Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term 
Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR
credit issue As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call 
 
You note that attached to the email is a  legislative fix  to AB X that could
solve the credit issue and an attached set of  taking points  related to a
second alternative to solving the credit issue a PUC order clarifying that
DWR will get its money for power purchase costs 
Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to
get the utilities out of the merchant function Accordingly i’ve put a
brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section
 legislative solution under the topic  create a real competitive retail
market in California   To the best of my knowledge we don’t have
legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to
discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so 


If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please
dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss I can be best
reached to day by pager at 

Thanks to all for helping pull this together

Jim 
It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday Based on our conversation 
this email includes the following 

An Enron contact to discuss developing small scale generation on Tribal lands 

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on how
to remove those impediments 

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR s ability
 to
sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two
possible options for addressing the credit issue are a California PUC
order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through
rates and an amendment to AB X designed to accomplish the same goal I
have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and proposed
amendments to AB X We believe that an amendment to AB X is the preferable
option 

Our assessment of the supply demand picture in California 

Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near 
and long term electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your
office tomorrow detailed legislative language In those materials we will
also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our
proposed language 

I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact me
if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anything
else that I can do to assist you

 Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand by Charges

Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took
 a
step in the right direction Utility stand by charges have always been
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract
monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit the
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduce
the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by
offering amendments to SB X which is designed to facilitate development of
distributed generation 

Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with
investor owned and municipal utilities

Solution The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is 
a
step in the right direction D D    requires utilities to complete
interconnection studies within days California should ensure that this
requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed
generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome
through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent
possible California should shift control over interconnection away from the
utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be
accomplished through amendments to SB X 

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed i e  on site  generation that is MWs
 or
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission and
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large scale
generation faces 

Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D    thru
D    issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant
output apply equally to smaller scale  distributed generation  facilities 
In addition distributed generation that is less than MWs continues to
face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects
 
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB X to Purchase
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with
suppliers 
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with the
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible 
However ambiguities contained in AB X have created significant credit risk
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms 
We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons credit
risk concerns 
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements
going forward 

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our
analysis of the bill the language in AB X appears to leave intact the
California PUC s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California 
As
such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates
adequate charges to cover DWR s costs of power purchases 

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract  Prudence 
The language in AB X leaves open the possibility that the California Public
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are
 imprudent   On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref
use to
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power
purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that
DWR has entered into with suppliers 

Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to
Recover DWR s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority
noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to
the specific ratemaking  mechanics  that AB X directs the PUC to employ to
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it is
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensure
DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it 
is
difficult to determine whether AB X would even permit the PUC to include in
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR s power purchase
costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power 

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit risk
issues We have identified three options 

Amend AB X
The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the
PUC would accept as  prudent and reasonable  all purchase costs incur
red by
DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary 
to
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the
preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political
challenges standing in the way of amending AB X See attached file
entitled  AmendAB X doc  

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB X through an Order Issued by the PUC and
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to
implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly more
time to implement than the  legislative  fix We have attached electronic
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC
would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled 
 cpuctalkingpoints doc   

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to accept
other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit 
cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB X through a PUC order and through
contract amendments 

 Californias Supply demand Picture Heading into Summer 

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research
Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports
showing that California faces a severe supply demand imbalance They differ
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available All
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer
of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are
likely 

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this
summer by approximately MW These numbers are in line with our
estimates Californias supply base currently has a capacity margin 
 well
below the average   which is recommended for reliable system operation
in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power
than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced to
date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess the
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply 
Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to 
this
requirement 

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of include the early
draw down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias severe
supply demand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the
utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the current
pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be
added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest 

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately hours of
rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more
optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional 
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California
should view the CECs  rosy scenario  with considerable skepticism 

 Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve Californias
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We will
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals 

As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias
crisis must focus on four issues 

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return Californias Investor owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply  Legislative vehicle Sher 
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately years 
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less
than a year In California it takes about six years or longer 

The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legislation
are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve those
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit
requirements included in the CECs certification requirements Enrons
proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and 
transferring credits between air districts In addition it creates an
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund
emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected air
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the
required reductions in pollution emissions 

Decrease demand Legislative Vehicle AB X Wright 
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing
the supply demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished most
effectively and quickly in two ways 

Buy down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fund
to finance DWRs power purchases California could likely reduce demand
 more
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period e g 
through the summer months DWR could easily run an on line auction to
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To
participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the
reductions Enron has developed an on line auction software package  Deal
Bench   that it would be willing to contribute to the effort 

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful customers need access to the following key elements 

An internet based hour ahead price posting system to track the market price
for hour ahead power in real time 
Real time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment
verification 
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be
paid for load reduction  Negawatts  

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would include 

 creation  of additional summer peaking capacity in California particularly
in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation
resources 
reduction of peak or super peak load on the over stressed California
electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity 
in the state 
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full risk
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for
responding 

We estimate that we could generate a summer on peak demand response in
excess of MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for
summer on peak hours that could exceed MW We further estimate
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be to times
that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation 

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Legislative vehicle 
SB X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego were
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy
service providers Ironically AB X takes that important option away from
customers and businesses It is critical that AB X be amended to remove the
prohibition against Direct Access 

Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a
direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department of
Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from
customer migration 

In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procurement
is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial
condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement
function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a
non utility provider within months To execute the transition California
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the  month period 
in
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments
of utility load 

Return Californias Investor owned utilities to solvency Legislative 
vehicle 
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand 
In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supply demand
imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California
State government assume the role of  electricity buyer  for an extended
period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence
in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to
participate in that market 

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a
series of staged rate increases California should design those rate
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without
 shocking  the economy or household budgets For example California could
amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a   year period 
In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways 
First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of 
AB
 Second California can  net  the revenues the utilities have received
from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they have
accrued due to the retail price cap
